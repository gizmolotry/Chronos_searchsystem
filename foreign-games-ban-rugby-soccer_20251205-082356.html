      "raw_text": "Havine played and studied closely Gaelic football for the past twelve\nyears, I desire to direct attention to one aspect (and, in my opinion,\na grave defect) of the game; Imean the catchiny of the ball. While\nfully conscious of the many points from which the game may be\nviewed, I am convinced this defect is a grievous one, without any\nredeeming feature, and one that calls for immediate remedy. Its\ncontinuance will hamper the development of the game to a regrettable\nextent. Its removal would revolutionise the style of play, and\nIt would, moreover,\nconstitute no wanton attack upon any peculiar characteristic of the\nGaelic game.\nThe old “parish against parish, from ditch to ditch” methods,\n__ irrespective of, or rather anterior to rules, are all we have had to go\nupon in framing the present laws, so that in football we have no\nhistorical qualities to preserve, nor traditions to guide us. It may\ndevolve, therefore, on the present gerieration of Gaelic footballers to\nmould a game suited to the temperament, strength, speed and agility\nof young Irishmen of to-day and to-morrow.\n: We have, however, a valuable—if recent—experience to draw upon.\nDuring the regime of the G.A.A. the game has undergone many\nchanges; for instance—size of ground, scoring area and ball, number\nof players, manner of refereeing, duties of umpires, linesmen, etc. So\nthat there can be no sentimental reluctance to adopt a still greater\nreform which, while it will be immeasurable in its benefits, will not\nbe revolutionary in its tendency or effects.\nOne feature has remained unaltered throughout all the years and\nunaffected by changing laws—the dash, vim, and courage, agility,\nd, and strength of the men who play the game. Tt is in the con-\nviction that the reform T advocate will develope these qualities that\nI invite attention to my views.\nOne of the greatest impediments to the full development of the\ngame is the effects of the present permissive catching of the ball.\nYou cannot, according to-rule, charge a man, except he is in the act\nof playing the ball. Here is placed a premium on, and a barrier around\nthe player who comes into possession!

Then \nthere ore those delicious occasions when o genuine rapport is \nstr~ck up be~een two parties. A spark gets ignited, plenty of \nlucid soundb,tes ore exchanged and the world is left with on \ninterview the public, writer ond his gleeful respondent will read, \nre-read and generally get o whole heap of ever increasing kicks \nfrom. When this happens our media not only justifies its own \nsometimes intrusive existence, but our mediators {the journalists) \nprovide what moy tentatively be coiled a valuable service. \nNow at this point I'm sure your obit bofAed os to why I'm \ndeconstructing the labours of journalism ond not getting on with \nanother good old fashioned rant about wheel bases, wind tunnels \nand the vagaries of errant horse power. Well in truth its quite \nsimple really. I'm preluding o defence of Dornon Hill's so for \nlacklustre season {up to now that is, the time of writing, which is \njust prior to the British Grand Prix). You see for most of 1998 \nthere hos been o rather dork and gloomy cloud hanging over his \ncareer. He's gone from racing in 1997 with the promising but \nunderachieving TWR Arrows team to racing this year with the \nequally promising but under achieving Jordon outfit. A dearth of \ndecent results and the not unoccossionol experience of seeing his \nteam moles out qualify this ex-World Champion have led to many \na commentator expressing doubts not only over Damon's staying \npower but also in regard to his actual ability. Its frustrating for \nHill and infuriating for his followers, most of whom will point out \nthat it's not Dornon whose slowed down but the cars in which he's \nbeen travelling. A reasonable argument I suppose. Neither the \nJordon nor the TWR Arrows chassis have shown much in the woy \nof race winning speed, so fair enough. But for me the best evi­\ndence of Damon's real pace is contained in on immaculately con­\nceived interview he did some years ago with that hard old hack \nof English weeklies, Nigel Roebuck. \nIt was just prior to that year's Monie Corio Grand Prix and \nHill, the then William's driver, having been asked to chauffeur \nyoung Nigel down through the twists and turns of Monaco's \nsprawling coastline obliged to do so in one of his team's pleasant \nif rather sedentary (for an Fl driver anyway) Renault Lagunas. \nGreat thought Roebuck, there's no way on earth Hill can drive this \nthing like a sports car, cause it ain't one, and so no fear of \nDamon exiting corners at impossible speeds, scaring his hapless \npassenger senseless and thus nullifying the chances of a coherent \ninterview. As everyone knows -well they will after I tell them -\nthere is nothing quite as bad as trying to ask a few probing ques­\ntions while the man you're talking to does his utmost to stay well \noutside the speed limit and as much as possible entirely within \nthe farther reaches of his own personal best. It just can't be \ndone. \nIt was unfortunate then for Nigel tho! on this occasion \nDornon just happened to be in the mood for burning rubber, \nstretching parameters ond challenging the dynamics of adhe­\nsion. Nigel couldn't ever recoil such o sensation of complete \nond utter mind bending speed os that which Dornon supplied. \nCorners were os nothing, straights o blur ond with Roebuck hav­\ning shut his eyes in o panic of terror, blind bends were .... well, \ner ... blind. Neither could he remember much of the actual inter-\nW:~~~~,~1~~,~t,r~: \nview, fear having washed it from his mind, so it wasn't until later \nthat night {in the comfort of his stationary hotel room and with \nthe assistance of several glasses of Scotch) that he found time to \nrewind the lope and listen back. What struck him most was \nhow jittery and shaky his own voice was as against the fluid, \nassured and articulate responses from Damon. Hill was basical­\nly an insatiable speed merchant, on top of his game and without \nfear. \nGoing against all the odds the printed piece proved mag­\nnificent, an interview of the highest calibre. It highlighted not \nonl~ how good Roebuck was at his trade but equally how pro­\nfess1on~I and capable Damon was at his own. More poignantly \nthough 11 showed to the world that while Damon might at times \nlack the proper equipment one thing we should never doubt is \nhis unrelenting thirst for speed. @) \ndrop18",

          "text": "For years the art of fortune telling has been in existence. \nWhether it be through soothsayers, prohets or palm read­\ners guidance for the future has always been in demand. \nDuncan O'Toole went along to meet two such prohets \nwhen they visited Limerick recently \nSitting outside the Garryowen room in the Royal George \nHotel one notices the silence. The people waiting outside the \nroom talk in whispers as if in reverence to the people inside. \nIn the waiting area with me are two women, one from \nLimerick and the other has come as far as Ennis. Of the two \nit is plain to see that they both wont to believe that what \nthey ore about to do will work. One is good humoured \nabout it and soys she is only there to see what its like and \nthe other has been to a session like this before and it \nworked for her. \nWhen s0meone comes out of the room is tokes me bock to \nthe days sitting outside confession with your class motes -\neverybody enquiring how much penance the other got (the \nperson with the most being the coolest). \"What was it like?\" \nand 'What did he say\" where the main questions on the \ncollective lips in the waiting room. \nInside the room. ore Fergus Gibson and Adam Higgs. Both \ndrop18 \nhove special gifts that enable them to see things about peo­\nple that most others can't. Fergus Gibson is the man who's \nface graces the TV on shows such as \"Live at Tree\" and \n\"Don't Feed the Gondolas\" as well as the doily paper's \nhoroscopes. He specialises in reading peoples palms, their \naura and using the Cystal Ball. Adam Higgs is a medium, \nhe ma .kes communication with the spirit world and also spe­\ncialises in transfiguration which-involves spirits occupying \nhis body to communicate to people on this side of the world \n-it even involved certain things such as face change in the \nprocess. \nWhile most sceptics will laugh 9ff the idea of fortune telling \nand mediums it is very hard to do so when you are sitting \nface to face with the people that do it for a living. You can't \nhelp but get a bit paranoid when they look at you \"aw oh, \nhe knows what I'm thinking -oh no he heard that -ah can \nyou hear me stop looking .... \". After the initial relief of \nAdam Higgs saying that the spirit world can't talk through \nhim at the dr0p of a hat and that he would need deep con­\ncentration for this I relaxed slightly knowing that my ole \nGrand Uncle couldn't give out to me for not going to his \nremoval. If that relieved me, Mr. Gibson had the opposite \neffect when he told me I had to learn to forgive (seemingly I \nhad a deep stress point between my shoulders which I fool-",

After a bit of pleading \nMr. Gibson promised not to read me any more as I was \nfeeling slightly naked which isn't conducive to a good inter­\nview. \nFergus Gibson is a bubbly character and is as enthusiastic \n-\\· .; \n,\\t _, ... , \n~ ... '1 ·' \n~ -.;,,i• •: • I \nin real life as he is on TV -but isn't annoying in real life \n(sorry Fergus) his energy is infectious and you do want to \nbelieve when talking to him as you begin to like the guy. \nHe first realised that he had a gift at the age of 6 years \nwhen he told his mother about the dark colours he saw \naround a boy at school and felt that something bad was \ngoing to happen. When the next day young Master Gibson \narrived into school to hear that the same class mate had \ndied of an asthma attack he knew he had something. \nAdam Higgs can remember talking to spirits from as early \nas 12 years old, he then joined what is called a \"Circle \" \nwhere he was trained to develop his skills and use them \nproperly. He claims that \"loads of people have the gift to \ncommunicate with the spirit world maybe only a little bit \" \nbut they need to develop this gift and train it to work to its \nfull potential. Mr. Higgs claims to be able to talk to spirits \nand has \"guides\" who train him as he goes. Each level of \nlearning in the sprit world has different guides which are \nspirits that speak to him and advise him on things and how \nto improve his gift. Both Gibson and Higgs are adamant \nthat nobody dies as such but they merely leave their bodies \nand keep. their spirits -however, anxious as I was not to get \ninvolved in a religious debate, the mater of religion and \nhow the ·their work fitted into it was only skirted upon. \nSuffice to say there's a whole day's work in it. \nGibson's work is different to Higgs, while Higgs enables \ndrop17 \ncontact with the spirit world for anyone who is \"willing to \nbelieve\" Gibson can read into what kind of person you are \nand were you are going in life.

          "text": "SOCCER ROCKER \nAs the world cup fades into the distance for another four years \ndropping off the multitude of event junkies at some specialist \nBetty Ford Clinic, one is left to contemplate a few harsh reali­\nties. Firstly Holland who for my money were the best team in \nthe tournament this summer didn't make it to the final -let \nalo.ne win the thing. Penalty Kicks are a cruel Russian Roulette \n-mostly despised by footballers who have to take part in them \n~nd mostly loved and devoured by the neutral observer. I've \nsaid before on this page that penalties should be taken not \nnecessarily by your star strikers but by whoever has the balls \nto and, as they say, is \"up for it\". I have defended the \ncourage of Gareth Southgate and I am now commending \nDavid Batty for having the guts to have a go. Unfortunately \nfor him, his shot was saved and England went out. \nWhen Holland and Brazil went to penalties however, I was \ngobsmacked at a couple of players who raised their hands \nand deemed themselves willing to take one and even more \ngobsmacked by some who did not. Once again I'll say fair \nplay to Cocu (who incidentally had scored in an earlier game) \nand Ronald De Boer for having a go and congratulations to \nBrazilian Keeper Tafferal for saving them, but both shots could \nhave quite safely be filed under the same heading as \"defend­\ner's efforts\". The question is where were Holland's Hitmen? \nWith the exception of Dennis Bergkamp the entire Dutch attack \nsat down on the centre circle and stared at the grass hoping \nnot to be asked to take one and only got up lo link arms in a \nshow of unity after the five players had been nominated. \nWhere oh where was Patrick Kluivert? Pierre Van Hooijdunk? \nEdgar Davids? Clarence Seedorf? Marc Overmars?? Why \nwasn't a defender taken off in the dying seconds of extra time \nand Jimmy Floyd Hasselbank sent on to take one?? I mean I \nknow hindsight is an absolutely wonderful tool to win a match \nwith, but look at the list again, they can't all have had \nButterflies in their thummies surely? Nor can that lot have \nmade it in their career without having taken a spot before. \ndrop18 \nSecondly (there was a firstly about two paragraphs back), \nMick McCarthy's Republic of Ireland side will not in all proba­\nbility be going to the Euro 2000 finals in Belgium and Holland \nin just under two years time. Ireland's next competitive game \nis against Croatia in Landsdowne road in the Autumn . On the \nbasis of what we've seen of the Croats in the World Cup, \nIreland's enthusiasm, youth and raw talent will not be enough \nfor this team who came third in the World cup finals without \nthe aid of their star striker, Boben. But alas Boban expects to \nbe fit and ready just in time to make it for ... you've guessed \nit ... Dublin. \nYugoslavia who were beaten by a last minute goal by the \nDutch in the second round are also in our group and are also \nlooking like a team who could kick the arses off our boys in \ngreen if they're not very careful. If we have any hope against \nthese teams it's that neither look anything like infallible defen­\nsively. With that said though I still maintain that our best hope \nof making it to Euro 2000 lies in the volatile political land­\nscape that is the Balkans. Therefore the onus is on each and \nevery football loving Irishman and Irishwoman to do all that is \nwithin their power to fan the flames of war in that troubled \npart of the world ... nothing too nasty mind you ... just enough to \nget Yugoslavia, Croatia and Macedonia booted out of the \ncompetition. That will leave Ireland only needing to over come \nthe mighty Malta. Till the next time ....... Niall Quinn. @",

A spark gets ignited, plenty of \nlucid soundb,tes ore exchanged and the world is left with on \ninterview the public, writer ond his gleeful respondent will read, \nre-read and generally get o whole heap of ever increasing kicks \nfrom. When this happens our media not only justifies its own \nsometimes intrusive existence, but our mediators {the journalists) \nprovide what moy tentatively be coiled a valuable service. \nNow at this point I'm sure your obit bofAed os to why I'm \ndeconstructing the labours of journalism ond not getting on with \nanother good old fashioned rant about wheel bases, wind tunnels \nand the vagaries of errant horse power. Well in truth its quite \nsimple really. I'm preluding o defence of Dornon Hill's so for \nlacklustre season {up to now that is, the time of writing, which is \njust prior to the British Grand Prix). You see for most of 1998 \nthere hos been o rather dork and gloomy cloud hanging over his \ncareer. He's gone from racing in 1997 with the promising but \nunderachieving TWR Arrows team to racing this year with the \nequally promising but under achieving Jordon outfit. A dearth of \ndecent results and the not unoccossionol experience of seeing his \nteam moles out qualify this ex-World Champion have led to many \na commentator expressing doubts not only over Damon's staying \npower but also in regard to his actual ability. Its frustrating for \nHill and infuriating for his followers, most of whom will point out \nthat it's not Dornon whose slowed down but the cars in which he's \nbeen travelling. A reasonable argument I suppose. Neither the \nJordon nor the TWR Arrows chassis have shown much in the woy \nof race winning speed, so fair enough. But for me the best evi­\ndence of Damon's real pace is contained in on immaculately con­\nceived interview he did some years ago with that hard old hack \nof English weeklies, Nigel Roebuck. \nIt was just prior to that year's Monie Corio Grand Prix and \nHill, the then William's driver, having been asked to chauffeur \nyoung Nigel down through the twists and turns of Monaco's \nsprawling coastline obliged to do so in one of his team's pleasant \nif rather sedentary (for an Fl driver anyway) Renault Lagunas. \nGreat thought Roebuck, there's no way on earth Hill can drive this \nthing like a sports car, cause it ain't one, and so no fear of \nDamon exiting corners at impossible speeds, scaring his hapless \npassenger senseless and thus nullifying the chances of a coherent \ninterview. As everyone knows -well they will after I tell them -\nthere is nothing quite as bad as trying to ask a few probing ques­\ntions while the man you're talking to does his utmost to stay well \noutside the speed limit and as much as possible entirely within \nthe farther reaches of his own personal best. It just can't be \ndone. \nIt was unfortunate then for Nigel tho! on this occasion \nDornon just happened to be in the mood for burning rubber, \nstretching parameters ond challenging the dynamics of adhe­\nsion. Nigel couldn't ever recoil such o sensation of complete \nond utter mind bending speed os that which Dornon supplied. \nCorners were os nothing, straights o blur ond with Roebuck hav­\ning shut his eyes in o panic of terror, blind bends were .... well, \ner ... blind. Neither could he remember much of the actual inter-\nW:~~~~,~1~~,~t,r~: \nview, fear having washed it from his mind, so it wasn't until later \nthat night {in the comfort of his stationary hotel room and with \nthe assistance of several glasses of Scotch) that he found time to \nrewind the lope and listen back. What struck him most was \nhow jittery and shaky his own voice was as against the fluid, \nassured and articulate responses from Damon. Hill was basical­\nly an insatiable speed merchant, on top of his game and without \nfear. \nGoing against all the odds the printed piece proved mag­\nnificent, an interview of the highest calibre. It highlighted not \nonl~ how good Roebuck was at his trade but equally how pro­\nfess1on~I and capable Damon was at his own. More poignantly \nthough 11 showed to the world that while Damon might at times \nlack the proper equipment one thing we should never doubt is \nhis unrelenting thirst for speed. @) \ndrop18",

          "text": "wheels \nof steel \nMichael Lehane reviews the Tour's visit to Ireland ....... . \nA certain reverence surrounds the Tour De France which \ninspires greatness. Sean Kelly pointed this out when he \nsaid \"You think back sometimes to the races you've rid­\nden earlier in the season and it seems that you were \nonly riding to 85% of your limits. You didn't think it at \nthe time but when you ride the tour you know. This is a \nI 00% race\". The Tour coming to Ireland has already \nhelped create greatness. Paul Kimmage wrote the finest \npiece of sports prose last week when he recalled the \nmemory of Shay Elliot the first Irish man to wear the \nMailot Jaune, way back in 1963. This is a race that feeds \nbrilliance; look at Chris Boardman, an off form rider \ncoming into the tour last Saturday yet in this milieu he \nmanaged to win his third prologue in a convincing man­\nner. \nIt is a pity then that RTE failed to present a preview with a degree \nof substance. The Eurovision-type charade hosted by Mary Kenny \nand Stephen Roche was far too heavily dependent on pre-record­\ned material, but what was more frustrating about the show was \nthe short amount of time given over to Sean Kelly the fourth best \ntour rider of all time, competing as he did in 14 tours. Even more \ndisturbing than this is the failure to recognise other Irish riders \nwho competed in the tour over the last 15 years, these riders \nwere; Martin Early (who won the Pau stage in 1989), Paul \nKimmage and Laurence Roche. The former two riders achieved \nwhat many cyclist dream off when they completed the race in \n1986 and 1991 respectively. It was a grossly insulting act on the \npart of RTE not to invite these men on stage at Dublin Castle. \nJust to keep the negative tone in vogue, lets deal with the latest \ndrug related story surrounding the race. Cycling is a sport which \nis constantly back pedalling in relation to drug abuse. Blood tests \nhave been introduced but what could Willy Voet masseur with the \nFestina team, have in store for the 400 vials of illegal drugs found \nin his car two days before the Tour began? Unfortunately this inci­\ndent is just another symptom of a deeply rooted problems which \nhas plagued the sport. \nNonetheless, behind this malign barricade there lies a glorious \nrace which produces a constant glamour fused with excellence. \nNot even a rain filled Dublin Saturday can quench such glamour. \nDenis Le Proux, was the first rider to negotiate the 5.6Km pro­\nlogue route. His time of 6.43 sec's was the time to beat. The \njourney men riders and then the good domesiques (team wor~­\ners) started to roll off the ramp. The rain stopped the road dried \nand the crowds swelled as the quality riders began to emerge. \nFestina's Christophe Moreau set the most impressive early time of \n6:17.29.Then the big boys began to come down the ramp.Julich \nwas the first to get inside Moreau's time when he clocked in at \n6: 17:28. Then roll on Chris Boardman, the time trial specialist; his \ntime of 6: 12:36 seconds was categorical and last year's winner Jan \nUllrich could only manage a top 6 placing. So, Boardman as pre­\ndicted by this column wins the prologue with his precise measur­\ning of power, breaking and bravery. He got all three jerseys as the \nclouds left Dublin and Bertie Ahern smiled a smile befitting the \nworld's largest moving circus. \nDay two and fog hovers over the Dublin mountains. A massive \nday of sport lies in wait. There is a Munster Hurling Final, a \nGrand Prix, a World Cup Final and the Tour's first stage which is \nstarting and finishing in Dublin. The official start at Dundrum saw \nan Emotional Stephen Roche honoured in his home village. The \nfirst climb of the race is the \"Col de Wicklow Gap \".As the climb \nintensified flags blew in a versatile mass of colour as Zanin gri­\nmaced and summoned enough energy to win the mountain sprint, \nthus securing the Polka Dot jersey. \nIn Blessington Durand won the sprint and was joined by Van Hyfte \nas they broke and remained in the lead until the group reeled \nthem in outside Tallaght. With the Phoenix Park sprint nearing, \nCipollini (super Mario) looked as if he might deliver. Boardman's \nteam worked to protect him, unfortunately for Copolini, he and \nhis team mates collided and ended up sprawled out along the flat \nsurface. Tom Steels got the better of Zabel at the finish and won \nthe stage. Boardman finished with a smile on his face as he \nretained the Golden Fleece. \nOn day three there was Yellow every where, there were even \nFrench police on the street as a voice incessantly sang \"Le Tour de \nFrance\". The crowds lined up from Patrick Street to County hall \nin Cork. As the publicity cavalcade just arrived in Cork Chris \nBoardman crashed and watched another tour end early for him. \nThe race itself came out ofYoughal with Boardman's team mates \nmaking a break in honour of their leader. Then there as another \npile up as the peloton reached Tivoli. The race didn't stop and \nSpiarido came in the winner of the brisk stage however once again \nthis column gets the overall leader right with Zabel taking over as \nrace leader. \nIn an almost clinical style \"Tour de France en lrlande\" was sudden­\nly over. The event was bottled and corked and sent on its way \nback to Roscoff. Another 3,800 KM has to be negotiated. The \nserious stuff will begin when the fortunes of the riders will ebb \nand flow before they race up the Champs Elysees on August 2nd. \nPlenty more to be written about this tour yet, but if you want to \nmake some money then back Olano at ten to one, it could be as \nrewarding as a stage win! well not really. @) \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the tour de france \nin Ireland \ndrop20 \n_t \nCT \nTl \nB \ne, \nSC \nfr \na \ns \nrr \na \nu \nh \nV. \n0 \ntt \n\"I \ns \nh \nb \na \nir \n0 \ne \ns \nF \nV",

          "text": "J. \n( Limrock Profiles........ ) \nThis week Ronan Hennessy talks to local band PATROL. .... \nBaggy , \"Madchester'' and all those memorable sounds of the \nearly 90' s dance/rock crossover ... are Patrol its lineal succes­\nsors? Well these are the sort of things that matter to Patrol's \nfrontmen Johnny \nand Ronan C. \nSince their for­\nmation one year \nago this relatively \nunknown band \nhave immerged \nwith the intention \nof spear-heading \nthis so called \n\"Baggy\" renais­\nsance. They \nhave reason to \nbe anxious after \nall they are bear­\ning the reputation \nof this once leg­\nendary music \nsound while attempting to breathe valuable life into it. \nRonan is mad for it and the strength of his bands music together \nwith his own convictions are testimony of this. Patrol could easily \nshake off the Stone Roses tag but will others notice this vital \ndetachment? Of course with songs like \"Super Vague Dowie\" \nand \"Rapid Belly\" one should recognize this all important individ­\nuality. The band however are more certain about their mus ic. \nRonan hopes they'll be bigger than Asian \"Cos they are a great \nIrish band d'you whatha I mean\". \nPatrol are determined to put a more objective feel to the some­\ntimes muted expression wh ich is music. \"When I read Carl Jung \nor Nietzsche things just fall into place but still I'm still a lad d'you \nknow, I believe in intuition cos I'm not goin' subscribing to the \nbackwater of contrived masculinity I don't pretend and I don't \nread Loaded magazine\". \nTaking a band who seem so much in the know their knowledge \nof Limrock is suprisingly scant. Ronan says \"Yeah we are local \nband but maybe not in touch, I mean people go on about \nFigment but I never heard of them\". \nJohnny sees the band as hard working and generally steady with \na full year of practice and demo behind their backs but is only \nready to declare that unlike the \"Celtic tiger'' they are not exclu­\nsive . \"We truly love everyone\". \nPatrol will play alongside Box , Amber and Mosaic in a July 19 \nfixture at Costellos . \nCatch them waxing lyrical there or check out their further live \nsounds at this venue at a later date. @) \nSINGLES OF THE FORTNIGHT -Micheal Duffy \nco.uk -'Influenced' \nco.uk's infectious pop punk is the latest noise to be grab­\nbing some attention north of the border. \nThe Belfast threesome have been going down very well on \nthe live circuit of late and its easy to see why on their debut sin­\ngle 'Influenced'. \nConsidering their sound is nothing revolutionary, the title of \nthe single is rather apt. Their guitar riffs are very Kerbdog-esque , \nalthough it lacks the edgeiness of the now defunct Kilkenny trio. \nThe inevitable American influences are prominent, and parts of \nthe song are something akin to material on Green Day's multi­\nmillion selling album, 'Dookie', with shades of Stone Temple \nPilots also recognisable. \nNorthern Ireland has a habit of throwing up international \nsuccessful acts, and reports have co.uk following in the footsteps \nof Therapy? and Ash already. The boys recorded this single at \nHomestead studios were Therapy? launched themselves from, \nand with Bright Star Recordings putting their weight behind them, \nco.uk have alot going for them. \nThe b-side, 'Part of the Game' is perhaps an even better \ntrack than the single itself, and if their catalogue of songs are as \ngood as these two, keep an eye out for co.uk . ( 8/10) \n(our Lady Peace -'Superman's Dead.' ) \nii you only buy one single this fortnight, make sure its this \none. Our Lady's Peace have finally decided to hit the British mar­\nket, and about time to. \nHaving sold over three million records across the Atlantic in \nthe last year, these Canadian legends have had no desire to \nenter the fickle European market to date, but with their album due \nfor release shortly here they have finally taken the plunge. \n'Superman's dead' is the best single of the year so far and \nshould go along way in to making them a household name. \nIts brilliantly intertwined stop-start guitar work incorporating \nacoustic and electric guitar, together with its brilliant lyrics and the \nsubliminal vocals of Arnold Lanni let you know why there's a \nrepeat button on your CD player. \nSigned to corporate giants Sony, Our Lady Peace should \nget the exposure they deserve, and should definitely get an airing \non an MTV near you very soon. \nBands like Third Eye Blind and Marcy Playgound have \nthreatened in the last few months to be America's, or even \nCanada 's next big thing over here. Our Lady Peace deserve the \naccolade, and just might get it. \nLanni's whines during the chorus, \"Superman's dead, he's \nliving in my head.\" If he's in there, I can't wait for the album. \n(10/10) \nSound marks of the nineties \n( DAVID GRAY: A CENTURY ENDS . ) \nThere are but two types of people in this world : those who \nhaven't heard of David Gray and those who love him. If you are \nof the latter persuasion find something else to do and don't waste \nyour time reading this as you know what I'm about to say, if you \nare of the former, shame!, shame on you, but do not fear as \nredemption is at hand. \nGray, born in Manchester but brought up in Wales, so impressed \nPolydor A&R man , Rob Holden with his demo that Holden quit his \njob to become his \nmanager. The poten­\ntial which prompted \nthis impetuosity is ful­\nfilled on Gray's first \nalbum: A Century Ends \nreleased in 1993 on \nthe Hut label. You get \nthe feeling from Gray's \nnaked lyrics, delivery, \nand arrangements that \nthis guy means what \nhe says, and that what \nhe says means some­\nthing -there's no \"ooh \nbaby\"s or \"wot you like?\"s in here. Gathering Dust, perhaps the \nmost evocative song ever written by a Welshman, is so honest \nand heart rending that you can't help but feel for Gray in his mis­\nery and confusion. From the outset you become enveloped in \nGray's world, a world of hope (Shine), decay (A Century Ends, \nLet The Truth Sing) and casual sex (Debauchery, Lead Me \nUpstairs), a world, which if you wanted to you could not escape \nfrom such is Gray's genius. @) \n!9\"DP21",

' ', \n•.tp/'·~~~a;: ~n·~-w~~h~n ·~;e for/h~ men Gillian Cha~ke \nA profiles whats hot in men's fashion this season. \n.J \n:J FOR MEN \nThis week we take a look at the new trends in men's fashion and \nfashion accessories for the summer/autumn of'98 .. \nTweed suit; Unlike the cumbersome creations found in the \nwardrobes of ageing toffs, these lightweight designs go for style in \nplace of bulk. The single-breasted wool tweed suit is coming back to \nhaunt us. Jersey shirts; In the spring you'll have bought the short­\nsleeved version, now its time to go long, especially if the Irish sum­\nmer we are experiencing this \nyear continues. Corduroy; In \njackets, shorts and trousers, \nmaking a comeback after a \nlong, long absence. Although \nsome of you out there know \nit was a winner and didn't dis­\ncard a single cord!. Brown or \nnavy corduroy zip-up jackets \nwill always make a statement. \nBurgundy; For so long an old \nman 's colour, the craze for all \nthings Seventies has swept \nburgundy back in. Go for \nchunky wool knit burgundy \njumpers and burgundy wool \ntrousers. Combat pants; \nThe stride that's giving the five­\npocket Jean a run for its money . Whether you choose the shiny vis­\ncose look or the dull cotton, either will get you noticed. \nLeather; Instant tough for even the weediest individual, worn in \nblack or brown or burgundy as was seen as part of Louise Kennedy's \n\"Luvvly Jubbly\" collection. Styles include suit cuts, bomber jackets or \nloose like a car coat. Another good buy this year is the double­\nbreasted short trench sheepskins in, yes, brown. Go raid your Dad's \ncloset and you just might find what you are looking for. \nACCESSORIES \nGold jewellery; After lengthy domination of the accessory market \nby the metal known as silver, gold is back. Tip: try to avoid the \"Mr. T\" \nlook. Go for the more wealthy \nman about town appearance \nwith heavy gold link and solid \ngold square design bracelets, \nand the classic gold cufflinks. \nShades; Snowboard-influenced \nwraparound sunglasses with \ncamouflage design or for the \nrockstar look, black horn­\nrimmed frames with yellow \nlens. There may not be any sun \nto keep out but you will look \nsuper cool. Nokia phone and \npersonal computer; An office \nin your pocket on even the \nremotest of mountains, although they have been making them more \ncompact these days. No look is complete this season without a high­\ntech gadget of some shape and form. \nHi-tech watches; Indestructible and posing a severe threat to the \nworld's metal reserves, these are watches at the cutting edge of \ntime-telling. Formula I watch with orange face or the new phycho­\nkenetic by Seiko, well worth half a grand. Whatever next? Electric \nshavers; This year's essential accessory. If you don' have the dosh to \ngo out and buy one then just pre­\ntend it's your birthday and get \nyour friend to buy one for you. \nIn the coming weeks we speak \nwith Marc O'Neill who is \nregarded as one of Ireland's most \ncontemporary and saleable \ndesigners. \nBorn in 1970, Marc first studied \nat the National College of Art \nand Design in Dublin, from \nwhere he graduated in 1993 with \nan honours degree in Fashion \nDesign. His designs are focused \naround clean cut tailoring with \nattention to detail, and is acces­\nsorised with co-ordinates and separates such as masculine shirts, tai­\nlored and unstructured dresses, knitwear, jersey, and leather. \nOne of Marc's evening wear outfits shall be on show at the 1998 Miss \nLimerick pageant on Tuesday 14th next. He has most generously \ndonated one of his evening wear outfits to Drop's Miss Limerick repre­\nsentative Ms . Gillian Sheehan. Go Girl. @",

A spark gets ignited, plenty of \nlucid soundb,tes ore exchanged and the world is left with on \ninterview the public, writer ond his gleeful respondent will read, \nre-read and generally get o whole heap of ever increasing kicks \nfrom. When this happens our media not only justifies its own \nsometimes intrusive existence, but our mediators {the journalists) \nprovide what moy tentatively be coiled a valuable service. \nNow at this point I'm sure your obit bofAed os to why I'm \ndeconstructing the labours of journalism ond not getting on with \nanother good old fashioned rant about wheel bases, wind tunnels \nand the vagaries of errant horse power. Well in truth its quite \nsimple really. I'm preluding o defence of Dornon Hill's so for \nlacklustre season {up to now that is, the time of writing, which is \njust prior to the British Grand Prix). You see for most of 1998 \nthere hos been o rather dork and gloomy cloud hanging over his \ncareer. He's gone from racing in 1997 with the promising but \nunderachieving TWR Arrows team to racing this year with the \nequally promising but under achieving Jordon outfit. A dearth of \ndecent results and the not unoccossionol experience of seeing his \nteam moles out qualify this ex-World Champion have led to many \na commentator expressing doubts not only over Damon's staying \npower but also in regard to his actual ability. Its frustrating for \nHill and infuriating for his followers, most of whom will point out \nthat it's not Dornon whose slowed down but the cars in which he's \nbeen travelling. A reasonable argument I suppose. Neither the \nJordon nor the TWR Arrows chassis have shown much in the woy \nof race winning speed, so fair enough. But for me the best evi­\ndence of Damon's real pace is contained in on immaculately con­\nceived interview he did some years ago with that hard old hack \nof English weeklies, Nigel Roebuck. \nIt was just prior to that year's Monie Corio Grand Prix and \nHill, the then William's driver, having been asked to chauffeur \nyoung Nigel down through the twists and turns of Monaco's \nsprawling coastline obliged to do so in one of his team's pleasant \nif rather sedentary (for an Fl driver anyway) Renault Lagunas. \nGreat thought Roebuck, there's no way on earth Hill can drive this \nthing like a sports car, cause it ain't one, and so no fear of \nDamon exiting corners at impossible speeds, scaring his hapless \npassenger senseless and thus nullifying the chances of a coherent \ninterview. As everyone knows -well they will after I tell them -\nthere is nothing quite as bad as trying to ask a few probing ques­\ntions while the man you're talking to does his utmost to stay well \noutside the speed limit and as much as possible entirely within \nthe farther reaches of his own personal best. It just can't be \ndone. \nIt was unfortunate then for Nigel tho! on this occasion \nDornon just happened to be in the mood for burning rubber, \nstretching parameters ond challenging the dynamics of adhe­\nsion. Nigel couldn't ever recoil such o sensation of complete \nond utter mind bending speed os that which Dornon supplied. \nCorners were os nothing, straights o blur ond with Roebuck hav­\ning shut his eyes in o panic of terror, blind bends were .... well, \ner ... blind. Neither could he remember much of the actual inter-\nW:~~~~,~1~~,~t,r~: \nview, fear having washed it from his mind, so it wasn't until later \nthat night {in the comfort of his stationary hotel room and with \nthe assistance of several glasses of Scotch) that he found time to \nrewind the lope and listen back. What struck him most was \nhow jittery and shaky his own voice was as against the fluid, \nassured and articulate responses from Damon. Hill was basical­\nly an insatiable speed merchant, on top of his game and without \nfear. \nGoing against all the odds the printed piece proved mag­\nnificent, an interview of the highest calibre. It highlighted not \nonl~ how good Roebuck was at his trade but equally how pro­\nfess1on~I and capable Damon was at his own. More poignantly \nthough 11 showed to the world that while Damon might at times \nlack the proper equipment one thing we should never doubt is \nhis unrelenting thirst for speed. @) \ndrop18",

G. B . would \nnot issue an order which would repeat such a fiasco. \nYet, in fact they have done worse. Th ey have placed \nthe County Councils in the imp ossible position of being \ncalled on to pay over to the Urban Councils certain \nlarge sums of mon ey for their upkeep actually before \nthe county Councils receive it themselves, and this \ncould only be done by taking funds earm arked for par­\nticula-r objects and using them illegally for other \npurposes. \nThe m atter has come to a direct issue between the \nDublin County Council and certain of the Unions, and \nDistrict Councils, and the L . G . B . will now find them­\nselves in a tight corner to justify their Public Bodies' \nOrder directions to the Local Bodies. For mon ths past \nthe press has teemed with denunciations of this Order­\nits absurdities; its impracticable and useless and con­\ntradicting directions; its costliness and worthlessness, \neven if it is enforced. As Mr . O 'Neill the chairman of \nthe Dublin County Council explained last week , one of \nthe provisions of this fa~ous Ord er relieved the Urb ~n \nCouncils from making p~yments to the County Councils \ntowards the discharge of certain liabilities which they \nwere called on to pay for till two months after the \ndate on which those payments formerly became du~. \nA short time since a deputation of the General Council \nof the County Councils of Ireland waited _on the Local \nGovernment Board, and asked for the withdrawal _or, \nat least the modification of that famous \"Order,\" so far \nas this point was concerned. It was shown to Sir Henry \nRobinson that it would be impossible for the Coun ­\ncils to carry out. their adminis~i:ation on ~he terms laid \ndown in the ·Order. It was pomted out 111 the case of \nthe Dublin County Council as an example that they \nwere called on to pay sums exceed~ng £30,0001 quar,terl;y, \nthe payments being made to Umons and Umons Dis­\ntrict Councils within the taxable area of the County \nCouncil. The Urban Councils who collected and con­\ntributed the funds which were to be distributed, co~­\ntended that they were not b?und to _make payments 1,n \nadvance to the County Council a_ccordmg to. the L.G .~ . s \ndirections. The County Council took a drffe_rent view. \nThe matter was thrashed out before the Supenor Courts, \nand the County Council's view was upheld, the result \nbeing that until the \"New Public Bodies' ~rcler\" was \nissued the Urban Councils collected and pai;l over the \nmonie; to the County Councils, so that it ~1ght be re­\nimbu1·sed to the Unions and District Counmls at a cer-\ntain date. • · 1 d The recent Order, however, despite of the judicia e-\ncision has again revolutionised the procedure. The \n:L. G.'B. seem to be above\" law and order.\" They in­\nformed the Urban Councils to hola back the money \nSplendid opportunity for country stud~nts ! Thorough \nand rapid coaching for all exams. Particulars from all \nIreland Correspondence College, 33 Lr. Abbey Street, \nDublin.· \ncollected. This discrepancy, to call it by its mildest \nterm between the direction of the Coui-\"ts and the order \nof the L . G. B ., as well as sundry other odd matters in \nthat famous Order, was pointed out to the chairman of \nthe L. G . B-. at the interview of the deputation who \nwaited on him a month ago, and asked how \nthe County Council were to proceed under the \ncircumstances. He was stumped by his own \norder. He asked for time to consider a way out of \nthe impasse. Sir Henry Robinson has had a month to \nthink it over, and he is still thinking it over. Mean­\nwhile the Unions and District Councils of the County \nDublin are partially bankrupt for funds, as the Dublin \nC oun ty Council, fortified by the legal decision of the \nSuperior Courts, declines, or rather has no fuuds if it \nw ere w illing to distribute them .. Not to leave the \nUni ons altogether in the lurch, certain moieties of the \nmoney have been \"placed to the credit of the District \nCoun cils and Unions , for men's w ages must be paid, \nD octors mu st get their salaries, and paupers must be \nfed though Local Government Bo ards issue absurd \norders. The Dublin County Council has put its back \nto the wall, howe ver, and mean s to m ake Sir Henry \namend his Ord er or else cause chaos in the financial \narrangem ents of the public bodies concer'ned. I have \ndealt rather at length with this matter, which perhaps \nis some.what technical in its bearings, and so would not \nbe und erstood by many, unless clearly explained. I \nhope I have made it clear to Sir H enry Robinson and \nhis Board ancl the public bodies wh o are ruled by him, \nthat the \" Public Bodies' Order '' needs amendment;-. \nand in fact in this matter, as in m any other cases, is \nimpracticable to carry out. Will Sir Henry and his \nBoa.rd learn wisdom even ·at the eleventh hour ? When \nthe Judges have decided against them , surely their law \nadviser should take the hint. \nAnd now to turn to the Agricultural Department. \nAs I pointed out in last issue, the attempt to grow \ntoba.cco and cm ·e it last year has been a fair success, and \nI am pleased to record it; though, as Colonel E -verard \nstates, the American expert, through some bungling of \nthe Department, did not arrive on the scene until the \ncrop was gathered in and partially cured. This year, \nin addition to Col. Everard's thirty acres, it would ap­\npear in a second series of plots in the County Wexford, \namounting to some 15 acres, the plants are to be grown, \nand provision will be made to help the farmers to dry \na.nd cure the crops.. But why is the permission to grow \nthe plants restricted to two places, now that it has been \nproved the industry is a successful and a profitable \none? Why more especially when there is such a splen­\ndid concession given in the reduction of one-third of \nthe duty by the Tax authorities? Last year several \napplications were made to the Department to be allowed \nto grow the pla~ts, and the Department instead of \nhonestly and straightforwardly refusing the permission, \nfor which possibly they had valid and sufficient reasons, \nshuffled and dallied with their replies, throwing the \nonus of refusal on the Inland R evenue Department .. \nThis \"is as unfair to the latter Department as the con­\nduct of the Agricultural Board is uncandid. \nAs I have stated, the Inland Revenue officials have \nbeen more than generou·s in their treatment of the Agri-. \ncultural Board in handing over to the latter the right \nto select and nominate persons who may be allowed to \ngrow the tobacco plant, and it is grossly unfair to put \nthe onus of refusal on that body. Yet this is what the \nAgricultural Departme~t has done, and is doing still. \nLast year two or _three applications were made to the \nInland Revenue Department, who in the terms of the \nagreement made with the Agricultural Board, referred \nthe applicants to the latter Board.

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

This is encouraging for all the talented unknown bands out \nthere who will still feel it worthwhile to get their tracks on demo and \nhope they will be the lucky ones. \nCrush's demo was very well presented and the production was of very \nhigh quality. This three piece comprising of Robbie Callan Vinnie Ryan \nand Keith Walker also put together three impressive tracks that definite­\nly leave a lasting impression. The opening track \"Control\" is excellent. \nA high tempo'd track full of barraging guitar work which hos a memo ­\nrable chorus. Callan has a very wide ranging voice and the instru­\nments all compliment each other. The second song on the demo is \nquite different \"Radio Telescope\" slows things right down with harmo­\nnious backing vocals and a memorable guitar solo. The final track \n\"Only this\" is in my view the pick of the three songs. It processes a \nvery imaginative soundscape and a lyrical substance not apparent on \nthe previous tracks. It balances slow and rhythmical verses with a loud \nand abrasive chorus with ease. \nMy only criticism is that the tracks do sound very alike in places and \nan album of such material may become monotonous. Overall though it \nis a highly impressive start for Crush and one which they can build on. \nFor anyone who missed them in the Warehouse or who saw them and \nwant to see them again pop into Bruxelles in Dublin the next time \nyou're there as they play a regular spot there (Mondays I think, not \nsure ring in advance -word is they are touring outside of the country \npretty shortly). - 8/10 \nHANRATTY\"S \nEXCLUSIVE \nNITE CLUB \nDANCE 60's, \n70's, 80's. \nHANRATTY'S HOTEt;. \nGLENTWORTH ·STREET \n(061) 410999 \nIRISH MUSIC \nliHURSDAY NIGHli \nF.RIDAY NIGHJ \npr:oduct product \n1nd1e kids \nOne to Watch \nThe Hormones - \"Don't let them get you down\" \nWe 've heard time and again that to make it big in the music world you \nneed a lot of luck and then some more. Based in London like a lot of \nour best mus icians intent on making it big, The Hormones ·have just got \ntheir slice of the luck cake. While recording the soon to be seen wed­\nding episode in London -the cast of friends decided they needed a \nband to be part of the episode -and who did they pick but the \nHormones -a band creating a lot of interest amongst record compa­\nnies in England and further a field at the moment . Being one of the \nworld's most popular shows in the Friends had the ability to tum the \nRembrandts into a multi million selling band, so the Hormones have to \nbe excited by the possibilities. \nThis, their current single, will probably do well in the next couple of \nweeks but is it really good? The Hormones music is bright breezy \nmaterial full of melodious harmonies and chirpy rhythm guitars. The \nlyrics of \"Don't let them get you down\" although not the song sang in \nfriends is suited to Friends-its almost as if it was written for the show \n\"You want to have your friends to be friends to the end then forever\" \nThe single is definitely long summer evening music. Feel good music at \nits best yet its happy sounds disguise its downbeat lyrics. \"They think \nthat they know you but they don't they think they will but you know that \nthey won't\" The three extra tracks on the single reveal a dept to the \nband \"Be what you are\" is a fast paced and up tempo'd. \"Ballad of a \ndrifter\" and \"Oh lord, sometimes\" are whimsical ballads not unlike \nthose of Scottish band teenage fan dub .

It was quite \nfrightening\". \nOther injuries during the game occurred to Bell and Topping. \n\"Topping fractured his Collar bone after the second try and \nwill have to leave on Thursday. He's in a sling, the fracture \nisn't coo bad. Bell only has a hamstring problem so we'll give \nhim intensive treatment and hold on to him. Hopefully he will \nbe playing later in the test.\" \nApart from the injuries, things are going extremely well for \nthe team, according to Denise \"the morale is wonderful. .. the \ngame was great, anytime we had a chance for a cry we scored \n9 out of ten times.\" When asked what the victory could be \nattributed to Denise replied that \"the team have improved \nconsistently after each game this season and were unlucky not \nto have won any matches until now. On Saturday however \neverything came together - it was a great victory. There was a \nlarge Irish contingent at the game - Lansdowne RFC were \ntouring in the area at the time so they came to the match \nbefore going home .

Speaking from the hotel in \nWilderness, Denise could tell us that the weather was great \neven though its the African Winter there at the moment . \n\"The part of Africa we're in for the first few games, is one of \nthe most beautiful regions in South Africa. We've been on one \nexcursion so far and that was when the team went up to the \ntop of Table mountain - that was amazing\" \nWhile the team are on a strict training regime they have been \nallowed out to shop and sight see etc. and with one member \nof the team, Dion O 'Cuinneagain, being from South Africa \nhimself the team are getting the inside track on everything \n\"its great because Dion is from Cape town where our first \nand third game are and where we are at the moment \n(Wilderness) is where he used to go on his holidays when he \nwas younger so he shows us the best places co go and every­\nthing\" \nAc the time of talking to Denise the team were busy prepar­\ning for their second and third matches.

The Reprise release My Way -The Best \nOf, \nwhich peaked at number 13 last year, looked \non course to climb around 30 places in the \nchart as two of the singer's Capitol albums, \n~ongs For Swingin' Lovers and Swing Easy, \nvied for a chart return. \n·i ./ • .. ,.-\nSales of a number of other Sinatra albums also picked up, as did his 1969 sin­\ngle My Way . But retailers say the public response has been more steady than \nwith previous big-name deaths because his death has been sadly anticipated \nfor some time and thus sales have stayed high for a couple of years. \nFaithless will be following their m illion-selling debut 'Reverence' w ith a new \nalbum, 'Sunday 8PM ', in September. Last week saw a two-track sampler, \n'Bring My Family Back'fShe's My Baby', mailed out as part of the run-up to \nthe new album. The two tracks on the sampler are decidedly downbeat, unlike \nhouse epics such as 'Insomnia' and 'Salva Mea ' wh ich helped the group sell \n4m singles world-wide. The first proper single release w ill be 'God Is The DJ', \nthe video for wh ich will be directed by group member Jamie Cato who recently \ndirected the video for Cheeky labelmate Skinny's single 'Failure'. The single is \none of the album's up tempo tracks but is apparently completely differen_t in \nsound to the group's previous hits. Faithless will be playing all of Europe's \nmajor festivals this summer including Glastonbury, Womad and V98 . \nAfter winning a Grammy award for Best Rock Instrumental (\"Block Rockin' \nBeats\"), electronica duo the Chemical Brothers are set to have their own label, \nFreestyle Dust, distributed by Caroline.

Ten tumultuous years, \nso,:ne gloriously high, some depressingly low, but \nwhile others of their ilk have foundered and fallen by \nthe wayside, the Jungle Brothers soldier on. In a \ngenre where many talk of longevity, but few attain \nthat level of durability, the Jungle Brothers have \nachieved just that without succumbing to passing \nfads that slide snake-like in and out of rap. They \nremain true to themselves and their beloved art. \nSo since De La Soul pulled there Cork show for the \nSouthern Soul and Disco Festival, the Jungle \nBrothers stepped in and replaced them, nice one \nlads. So we at Drop said to ourselves why not give \nMike G a ring in Los Angles and see what's up with \nthe Jungle Brothers .... \n\"We're family men now, and we realise what we do is \nconsequential, so we watch what we say and do. We \nrespect ourselves and others, but that doesn't mean \nwe have softened, on the contrary! We're new we're \nborn again. That vibe, that feeling that's present on \nthe new album isn't forced, it's totally natural. It runs \nright through us, on 'Raw Deluxe' there's spontaneity, \nthe moods, messages and beats all lock together.\" \nSo now that ten years have past for The Jungle \nBrothers, what does the future hold? \n\"When we're here another ten years from now, come \nsee us. That's what we're working towards. We're in \nthe middle of our careers, we still have a lot we want \nto do.

It's no mean achieve­\nment when you consider that this time last season Limerick \nwere well rooted to the bottom of the division with some \nfans uncertain as to whether we'd even be playing national \nleague football this season. \nNext season looks promising already with the likelihood of \nmore convenient Friday or Saturday kick offs for Limerick's \nhome games, to the potentially treacherous Sunday after­\nnoons where fixtures can clash with over hyped, frilly pack­\naged, half arsed crap that Sky Sports peddles as well as \nforcing Limerick to compete with our oh so popular Rugby \nClubs for punters. Anyone who's been to see Limerick \nplaying on the same day as a big local rugby match will tell \nyou that they didn't have to queue long for their half time \nmug of mushroom soup. The magic and wonder of Friday \nnight football is being brought to us courtesy of our infa­\nmous floodlights. Actually I'm not going to say anymore \nabout them as everytime I name a date by which they will \nbe up and running, twelve to eighteen months is added to \nthe time by which they arrive. Lets just all keep our fingers \ncrossed. \nSo here we are -mere days before the kick off of World \nCup 98 and as our boys in green will be watching this one \nin the pub, most of us Irish will probably be shouting for \nthe tartan army of Scotland and maybe also the Reggae \nBoyz of Jamaica. But make sure to tune in to see Yugoslavia \nwho are in Group F with Germany, Iran and the USA The \nYugoslavs will be among Ireland's opponents in the Euro \n2000 qualifiers which start in the Autumn. So will Croatia \nwho we play in our first game in September and you can \ncatch them in group H along side Argentina, Jamaica and \nJapan. It won't surprise me in the least if Croatia win that \ngroup. \nSo I hear you ask? Who are the surprise team of this tour-\nnament going to be? Who will win the Golden Boot? What \nbig teams are going home early? Where will the coveted \nWorld Cup be flown to in July? And where oh where will \nCameroon and Jamaica get their herbs man? Well as an \nunapologetic romantic who always roots for the underdog \nI hope the Scots have a good run and the Jamaicans too. I \nalso hope that whoever the hell wins won't have won it \nbefore and in that respect I'm going to put a few quid on \nHolland. \nLimerick's Albert Finnan makes an uncomfortable no non-\nsense tackle during the recent clash with UCO \nFrance being hosts as well as a fine football team would be \na reasonable bet for a first time winner though some host \nteams in the past have found the weight of expectation as \nmuch a burden as a help .... ltaly 1990, Spain 1982. \nReigning Champs Brazil have had an indifferent warm up \nwhich probably means they are going to win the damn \nthing, but Scotland couldn't have got them at a better time \nthan the opening game. Brazil seem to find the group \nstages of these things, tedious torrid affairs, where no hop­\ners like Scotland and Norway fight out their petty squalid \nquasi Kung fu tournaments in the fleeting hope of some­\nhow scraping through to the knock out stages where \nBrazil's collective heads are at long before a ball is kicked. \nIn such a situation it's more out of conviction than hope \nthat I could see the Scots take at least a point from Brazil. \nWe'll know soon enough .. Scotland play Brazil in the open­\ning game of France'98 at 3.30pm on Wed I 0th June.",

It was quite \nfrightening\". \nOther injuries during the game occurred to Bell and Topping. \n\"Topping fractured his Collar bone after the second try and \nwill have to leave on Thursday. He's in a sling, the fracture \nisn't coo bad. Bell only has a hamstring problem so we'll give \nhim intensive treatment and hold on to him. Hopefully he will \nbe playing later in the test.\" \nApart from the injuries, things are going extremely well for \nthe team, according to Denise \"the morale is wonderful. .. the \ngame was great, anytime we had a chance for a cry we scored \n9 out of ten times.\" When asked what the victory could be \nattributed to Denise replied that \"the team have improved \nconsistently after each game this season and were unlucky not \nto have won any matches until now. On Saturday however \neverything came together - it was a great victory. There was a \nlarge Irish contingent at the game - Lansdowne RFC were \ntouring in the area at the time so they came to the match \nbefore going home . The Capetown Irish Club were shouting \non the team also\" \nWoody will be joining them on Saturday for the game in \nCapetown against the Western Province which promises to be \nanother extremely physical game - all the tickets are sold out \nahead of the game. \nThe team train each morning until midday and finish up for \nthe Mid day sun sets in. Speaking from the hotel in \nWilderness, Denise could tell us that the weather was great \neven though its the African Winter there at the moment . \n\"The part of Africa we're in for the first few games, is one of \nthe most beautiful regions in South Africa. We've been on one \nexcursion so far and that was when the team went up to the \ntop of Table mountain - that was amazing\" \nWhile the team are on a strict training regime they have been \nallowed out to shop and sight see etc. and with one member \nof the team, Dion O 'Cuinneagain, being from South Africa \nhimself the team are getting the inside track on everything \n\"its great because Dion is from Cape town where our first \nand third game are and where we are at the moment \n(Wilderness) is where he used to go on his holidays when he \nwas younger so he shows us the best places co go and every­\nthing\" \nAc the time of talking to Denise the team were busy prepar­\ning for their second and third matches. DROP will speak co \nher next issue and continue giving an insiders view on what is \nhappening during the South African tour. \nDenise Attending to Corrigan at the first match (B~/1 h~s hamstring \ninjury in inset) \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the Irish rugby team in \nSouth Africa \ndrop20",

          "text": "NEW RELEASES \nTHERAPY? - \" Lonely, Cryin' Only\" \nThe return of Therapy? in the last two months, after \na short break, has been low key to say the least. One of \nIreland's most consistent performers of the nineties, \nthey returned in March with a critically acclaimed album \nentitled 'Semi Detached', and this single is the second \nto be lifted from the aforementioned. \nA change in line-up and a recuperation period after \nfive year of constant work was meant to be the spur for \nAndy Cairns and the boys to re-launch themselves on the \nIrish music scene with a bang. Unfortunately it hasn't \n.., I ,>. • \n•. •ct- '· .• -.. ' \n--~~ . • \n,, \nI \nreally worked out that way and the new album and subse­\nquent single have been and gone without to much atten­\ntion been paid. This single will probably follow in its pre­\ndecessors footsteps, but really it deserves more than \nthat. ' Lonely, Cryin' Only' is typical Therapy?, fast, loud \nand brisk at just over two and a half minutes. The open­\ning 15 seconds are innovative, a telephone ringing, and \nan answering machine telling us to \" leave a message or \nleave me alone\", leading into a Pixie-esque intro. \nThe rest is unmistakeable Therapy?, and their dis­\ntinctive sound has perhaps hindered the progression in \nan age where bands are perceived as being unimaginitive \nif they release too singles that sound alike. However \nTherapy? are not really bothered about fame and fortune \nat this stage. They will continue to do what they are \ndoing, and I'm sure their many fans will enjoy this record \nas much as their other releases. ( 7 /10 ) \nLIMERICK LIVE \nCRUSH -The Warehouse, May 21st. \nIf fast and furious power pop is your sort of thing, then \nwhy on earth weren't you in The Warehouse on May 21st. \nCrush treated the small, but enthusiastic crowd to a set of \na well crafted, confident songs that everyone seemed to get \noff on. \nHaving recently been very impressed by their demo, \nthe Dublin trio certainly lived up to my expectations. Right \nfrom opener 'Candy', they exuded a confidence and fluency \nnot often evident in a band in existence just under a year. ( \nThis could be attributed to previous experienced gained by \nRobbie Callan and Keith Walker in well publicised Dublin out­\nfit 'Power of Dreams' ). \ndrop21 \nTheir ability to turn slow, sublime verses into choruses \nthat makes you want to loose it (as in ' Only This') is quiet \nbrilliant, and each member seems to be perfectly in tune, \naccumulating in songs that sound just right. Highlights \nincluded the rip-roaring 'Somedays Control' and 'World turns \nAround', definite single material should the deserved oppur­\ntunity arise. \nCallan informed me that the band are jetting off \nStateside on June the 1st to follow up on some exciting \ninterest expressed since their last trip in March. Manager, \nDave Egan, has been in contact with Mike Judge, the cre­\nator of T.V's most open-minded music critics Beavis and \nButthead, and current hit 'King of the Hill' and the prospect \nof exposure on either show is a possibility. \nSpending time in America will do Crush no harm as \nthe Yanks are suckers for fast paced, melodious guitar \nmusic as bands like Everclear, Our Lady's Peace and Third \nEye Blind will testify. \nThe futures so bright, Crush should be wearing shades . \nLimerick Band in Fanning Sessions \nVeneer have recently been in \nDublin, there to meet with their \nlatest fan-Dave Fanning. Last \nweek the band took the trip to \nDonnybrook, Dublin 4, where \nthey met up with Peter Holidai \nwho produces the Fanning ses­\nsions (also co-produced \nJunsksters album), Jim Lockard \n(produces Fannings show) and \nDave Fanning. They spent the \nday recording a number of \nsongs to be featured on \nFanning's radio show shortly. \nThe band have just played their \nfirst live performance in months in Costellos last Sunday. \nThe reason for their absence from the live scene is that they \nhave been busy recording and writing new material. The \nband have set up their own studio so they never leave the \nhouse now!! A new single is due out in the Autumn com-\nplete with accompanying video. Interest in the band is said \nto be high. They have been making ears turn since their \ndebut EP in 1996 and after winning last year's Green Energy \nBands competition the band have enjoyed an increased \nrespect within the music industry. Keep a listen out for \nthem and their debut on Fannings sessions is due for \nMonday June 8th and a repeat two weeks later. \ni \nOFFER AVAIIABlE FOR A UMITTD PERIOD ONLY \n· . ~ ,:;t.\"=\" INTERNET TRAINING-INTERNET ACCESS \n• • THOMAS STREET LIMERICK 061 312066 \nInternet cafe £5:00 PER HOUR £2:50 PER HA~F HOUR \nr------------------, \nI I \nI I \nI HALF AN HOUR FREE 1 I I \n: INTERNET l \n: WITH EVERY ONE HOUR : \n: PURCHASED : \nI I \nI WITH THIS VOUCHER 1 \nL------------------~",

I must say that from the reaction of the audience any \nanxiousness was soon to be dispelled. An array of colours, materials \nand designs was to follow; Karen Flannery's gold and purple puffa \nbeach creation; Jennifer Whitty's golden shiny \"I dream of Genie\" \nlook; Mandy O 'Loughlin's Egyptian dancer. Notice a common theme/ \nNext up we have the 3rd year Diploma designs for the Limerick \nCharter 800 competition. The medieval creations would have felt \nquite at home at one of the Bunratty banquets. The designs of Joan \nHickson gained her I st prize. Joanne Hynes was another student \nwhose medieval rock punk style made quite an impression. Her col­\nlection represents the \"Anti-established dress codes for those who \ndeliberately dress morally incorrect\". \nLiam Greer's emerald shimmer 3/4 length dress was the envy of \nevery fashion conscious individual present. This particular design also \ncame I st place in the Heineken Colour in Your Life competition. \nAnother event which brought the LCAD students creativity and style \nto the fore was the Ponds Models for Charity competition held back \nin December 97 in the RDS . The designs encapsulated glamour and \nall that it represents. The designs ranged from a Jackie O' look from \nLaura Doyle; a Boogie Nights catsuit creation from Catherine \nMcDonagh entitled \"Mould Breakers\"; Niamh Lynch's black sequinned \nswingy look to a demure and Lady Like Lilac collection from Grainne \nPhealan; A witty collection from Alan Kelly \"36-26-36\" {I wish!} \nwhose period of work experience with acclaimed International cat­\nwalk· designer Vivienne Westwood s'eemed to be time well spent; and \nMargaret Condren's floaty dreamy look shown to the haunting \n\"Teardrop\" melody by Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraiser. \nThe Degree show finished the evening with a rapturous applause and \na standing ovation The individuality of each creation was a pleasure \nto behold, not knowing what was next to come. What did appear \nwas \"Warhol's Sisters\" from Hirsten French - Blessed are the avant-\ngarde for they shall inherit the earth. A\"luvvly jubbly\" collection \nfrom Louise Kennedy {good name} described as Delboy's Day Out, \nhumour and attitude. Oran Hallinan's \"DS7-!\" collection was based \non the Seven Deadly Sins and their depictions on the body. His use \nof colour and contrast reflected the eerie mood of the collection \nand unspoken taboos. Riona Cronin's \"Amythyest Flow\" won her \nmost Creatively Commercial collection. Full of myth and romance in \nmisted hues of purple and plum with floating textures of semi-trans­\nparent chiffon and knit. \nThe finale of the evening was this year winner of the Smirnoff Young \nDesigner competition Michelle Molloy. \"No frills\" but just a few \nthrown in, along with rubber wetsuits and lemon ballerina tutu's. \nWhere do the ideas stem from? \nCongratulations to all and many thanks for a spectacular show. See \nmost of you next year.",

He's in a sling, the fracture \nisn't coo bad. Bell only has a hamstring problem so we'll give \nhim intensive treatment and hold on to him.

On Saturday however \neverything came together - it was a great victory. There was a \nlarge Irish contingent at the game - Lansdowne RFC were \ntouring in the area at the time so they came to the match \nbefore going home .

Speaking from the hotel in \nWilderness, Denise could tell us that the weather was great \neven though its the African Winter there at the moment . \n\"The part of Africa we're in for the first few games, is one of \nthe most beautiful regions in South Africa. We've been on one \nexcursion so far and that was when the team went up to the \ntop of Table mountain - that was amazing\" \nWhile the team are on a strict training regime they have been \nallowed out to shop and sight see etc. and with one member \nof the team, Dion O 'Cuinneagain, being from South Africa \nhimself the team are getting the inside track on everything \n\"its great because Dion is from Cape town where our first \nand third game are and where we are at the moment \n(Wilderness) is where he used to go on his holidays when he \nwas younger so he shows us the best places co go and every­\nthing\" \nAc the time of talking to Denise the team were busy prepar­\ning for their second and third matches.

Steer the conversation to oileann \npipers, flautists and poets and m aybe the sam e son w on't be \nthought of at all. Yet, in fact, when it com es to the area of all arts, \nFinbar Furey is much m ore of a participator than realised . With a \n• poetry book already on the shelves, a novel due out next Ch ristm as, \nsolo tours w ith Stockto11 's W i11g alread y played and a possible future \nstage recce wi th D e D nnnw,, Finbar Furey is mu ch m ore of a 'renais­\nsance m an' t_han is given credit for! N ow returning to Lim erick and . \nthe University Concert H all on Thursday 19 January, on the third \nleg of the 'Four for the Road ' tour -sharing credits with Don \nBaker, Jimmy McCarthy and Mi ck Hanly - he continues to \nenjoy a reputation for solo work earned in his own right. \n\"Playing as the Fureys is very special to m e,\" claim s Finbar. \" \nOf course it is -I'm w ith m y brothers -but it's a set and wi th \nthe Four for the Road tour 1 can let a bit of steam off and \nshow off. I can play pipes, I can play banjo, I can play flute. \nYou know w hat i m ean, l can really show off! A nd -do it \nw here people don't know m e - A ll they know m e as is T he \nFureys playing 'Swee t Sixteen' and 'The Green Fields of France' and \nthey don't even know that I play the pipes I W ith Four for the Road \nI can really, reall),let loose, playing some of m y ow n music.\" \nTh e brainchild of promotions man , Barry Ga ster, the Fo ur for the \nRoad tour first sadd led up and m oved out last April. Bringing \ntogether four of Ireland's most recognised mu sicians, the idea was \nto allow audiences a taste of the favoured - if somewhat outwardly \nop posin g - mu sical styles that have influenced Irish m usic as we \nknow it today. It worked . Yet indeed, with bluesman Don Baker, \naward-winning country songwriter, M ick H anly and Jimmy \nMcC~rth y, possibly lreland 's most prolific contemporary Irish \nsongwriter claiming penned classics such as 'No Frontiers', 'Ride 0 11 ' \nand 'Katie', joining forces with the country's original purveyor of \nIrish trad', Finbar himself, how could it not ? \n\"We 've had a terrific response so far,\" claims Finbar, \"and we 've \nbeen really enjoying it as well. A s well as getting the chance to put \nour own music on stage, there's a lot of craic in w hat we're doing. \nAs they say -'boys will be boys' and~ boys will be real boys 1\" \nTt is quite obvious from talking to him that Fmbar Furey is a m an \nvery content with the life that he's reached. To count the years, it \nmay be a far cry from the-days when he and brother Eddie, were \nthe first to put a 12 string guitar and a set of oileann pipes together, \na far cry from the days when , as yo ung sters of a trad' scene that \nincluded the D11bli11ers, tl,e Clancy Bro/1,ers and l/1e C!,ieftnins, they \nwere given more than a few guest session spots, yet it's a life that \nhasn't veered from it's original track : Since the Fureys very first \nrecordi~g was played on British radio's Joh n Peel show in 1969, \nFinbar is still playing, still sessioning and still a trad' man at heart. \n\"I don 't feel any older. I'm still 20 years of age and I'm continuing \nwriting songs. I think the m inute yo u lose that you might as well \nthrow in the towel.\" \nW ith a da ughter, Aine, and a son, Martin, at the m omen t touring \nNorway with their band Bohinta, he does, howeve r, pity the youn g \nup -and-comin g Irish ballad players. \n\"It was very hard for us (the Fu reys) to get started but it's even \nharder now for yo ung bands and shame on the country for that. In \nour day it'was great because we had a lot of Irish m usic played on \nthe radio. Irish band s aren't given nearly enough of the airtim e now \nthat they need to succeed . Th ink of the Cranberries, for instance, \nwh o had to go away to mak e their w ay. No bod y knew of them -\nnever.even heard of them in Ireland - until all of a sudd en they're \nFrom Top L to R : Don Balter, Flnbar Furey, Mick Hanly and Jimmy McCarthy \n... bac k on the road \nin the Ameri can charts.\" \nH e isn't, however, too worried about his own childrens' musical \nfuture, singing their praises as only a father can. Ye t:·at the same \ntime, when that father happens to be Finbar Furey,_ you're inclined \nto take the eulogies that little bit more seriously. \n\"they've been wo rking around Ireland for the last few years and \nwe re finding it hard to get anything so they had to ·move out. But \nagain, wandering around the world isn't going to oo ·t_hem any \nharm either. They 're great musicians. The y. have there own imagi­\nnations and are not trying to walk in my foot_steps. Th ey're on a \ntotally different sort of trip with the music than I .am. :ou know, \nthey have the trad' roots but they're very contemporary.\" \nHe 's quick t; point out that wit!-\\ Aine boasting a first class degree \nin Celtic Studies and Martin a B.A. from Trinity College i_n History \nand languages, they - like there father -are pl<lying mu sic, \n\"because they love it. Because it's in them \". \nAs for the bould Finbar, his future continues on a much clearer \npath. Playing a sellout tour in Scotland's Na tional'Concert Hall, \nGlasgow, last M ond ay (16 Jar:i) w ith brothers and guest artist \nDolores Keane, and with a series of late January dates across \nIreland with the Four for the Road tour, his summer calender is also \nbooked up . The Fureys will be playng China and a first ever con­\ncert in South Africa. Until then, he'll be working on a solo album \nand his new book, already titled 'remember me l\\:ow'. \n\"I guess if I wasn't playing mu sic I'd .be either in the pub dodging \nthe guards or writing fulltime !\" he laughs. \"That's it really : W hen \nI get fed up with the pipes I lay them down and pick up the pen ; \nwhen I get fed up with the pen I start writing songs. But I think that \nif I was to ever really get fed up. ,;_,ith writing songs then it ·wo uld \nonly be because they we 're pt1tting me in a box and carting m e \naway! \" • .•. . \n(The FOUR FOR THE ROA£?

      "chunk_text": "WHAT'S THIS, A CHANCE TO HITCH A RIDE IN A \nMCIAREN AND YET HOSS CARNEY FIRMLY REFUSES. \nHE MUST BE MAD .... \nIn this age of chemical elements, weights and measures \nand God awful post-modern rationalist thinking its good to \nknow that despite all of Mclaren's obvious dull adherence to \nthe rules of straight-laced competitive hard graft, there are \nstill members of that organisation who like to occasionally \nattack their work from a lateral -even madcap -plateau. \nThe evidence of which is the brand new Mclaren MP4/98T -\na two seater Formula one car. Now for those of us who love \nGrand Prix racing but have so far been entirely unsuccessful \nin attracting the collective eye of Formula One's various team \nmanagers or in even acquiring the very basic necessity of an \nFIA approved racing-licence this might just be a case of Ron \nDennis and Co . (the head guy at you know who) making our \nstep up from super-mini to super-car that bit easier. Why so? \nWell, because Mclaren, in all their glorious Mercedes funded \nwisdom, have decided that a certain member of the anony­\nmous public shall get a chance to strap themselves into this \ncar, to hold on tight and to get hurled around Silverstone in \nwhat has to be the world's most expensive taxi and all with­\nout he or she footing any sort of bill, tab or debt. \nIn association with Autosport magazine (avail­\nable from Easons of Patrick street or Gleesons of Glentworth \nstreet) Mclaren are running a simple postal competition \nwhereby we -the anonymous public -buy a copy of \nAutosport, write our name and address onto a specially \nenclosed postcard (which the magazine supplies), mail the \npostcard and hey presto a couple of weeks later Mika \nHakkinen rings up telling us we've won the trip of a life time \nand that Ron Dennis is looking forward to our visit. Couldn't \nbe more simple. Then again so is the Lotto but as yet I \nhaven't had any call to celebrate that either. Yet I'd be a fool \nto discount chance entirely, certain Satanic Cults and dodgy \nSooth Sayers have promised that with enough self mutilation, \ndegradation and the odd large donation to their always \nshort of the final figure building funds, our prayers, or \nshould that not be our post cards, will be answered. With \nwhat though, junk mail from Mclaren H.Q. entreating us to \ncomfort disappointment with a David Coulthard lamp shade \nor even a Mika Hakkinen commemorative soup ladel? I don't \nthink so. The fact of the matter is I stand the same chance as \neveryone else in this competition, which when the Abacus of \nLife finally Rickers to a standstill works out as pretty much \ndiddly squat. \nNo, despite all my admiration for Ron and his team's \nwacky two seater, I can't bring myself to enter his generously \noffered competition. Its one thing not to win a million squids \nevery third or fourth evening, but to have my one and only \nchance of ever sitting behind the wheel of an active contem­\nporary Formula One car (well I would be behind the driver \nand he'd be in front of the wheel) missing out on something \nas cool as this would be too much. Much too much . I'd pre­\nfer to read about John Nobody from Nothingham who \n'SUCCEEDED IN LAST WEEKS COMPETITION, WELL \nDONE JOHN' and to sit back in the sure knowledge that I \nwasn't in so I couldn't have won. And not being in I could \nhave no regrets, and having no regrets would ensure I \ncould forget the whole matter and in so forgetting I could \ncarry on with my life almost perfectly ignorant of that which \nI could never have had in the First place - a trip 'round the \nblock in a Mclaren. Now you may take exception to my \nlogic, you may even disagree with my pessimism, but I'd \nwager a month of \nyou're own income that no one from Limerick is going to \nwin. I guess, when all is said and won, this is just another \ncase of God awful post-modern rationalist thinking over­\ncoming my latenf lateral madcapness. I almost feel sorry for \nmyself. But for those of you with a bit more Romance in \nyou' re bones don't forget its Autosport Easons and \nGleesons and its off the shelves come Friday. I guess all \nthat's left to say is good luck, and lots of it, 'cause For sure \nyou'll damn well need it! @) • \nHANRATTYS \nEXCLUSIVE NITE CLIJB \nIRISH MUSIC \nTHURSDAY NIGHT \nFRIDAY NIGHT \nHANRA TTYS HOTEL \nGLENTWORTH STREET \n(061) 410999 \nID£RICCIE ®® 9~ 9 i®9~ 9 ffi®9~o \ndrop19",

Bass Odyssey and Razor will \nhave releases out on the new distribution set up by the end of \nthe year. The progress of the label has been phenomenal \nand considering the label began in October 97, to have a \nworld wide distribution network by July 98 is a great success \nstory - let's hope now that the artists under the label will enjoy \nas much success \nVinyl records will be great suitors for Quadraphonic.

The rock-tinged number \nwas recorded for the soundtrack of the US blockbuster movie 'Godzilla' and \nis supported by a video which is reputed to have cost $1 m . The promo (pic­\ntured) -features Jay Kay watching 'Godzilla' in a cinema auditorium which \neventually gets swamped by tidal waves, Godzilla's foot, flying cars and heli­\ncopters. Jay Kay, who suffered a back injury during the filming, apparently \nreceived applause from the crew for his efforts. The single release of 'Deeper \nUnderground' will be supported by mixes from Jamiroquai themselves as well \nas Roger Sanchez, who mixed the outfit's last single 'Alright'. Downtempo \nmixes from A Tribe Called Quest's Q Tip are also waiting approval. \nMeanwhile, Jam iroquai have started working on the follow-up to their 6m· \nselling 'Travelling Without Moving' album. The album will be recorded at a \nstudio in Jay Kay's new U.K. residence. \nTony De Vit has been ordered to rest by doctors following a recent collapse \nand as a result has cancelled all DJ appearances in the foreseeable future. \nDoctors diagnosed severe exhaustion and fatigue. De Vil is also involved in \ncivil litigation with a former employee about the alleged removal of studio \nequipment from De Vit's Birmingham studio. \nFormer Madness singer and current TV show host Suggs \nis relaunching his pop career (again) - with the theme \ntune to the forthcoming movie The Avengers. \"I Am \" will \nbe released on August 17th as the lead track from the \nsoundtrack which will also include material from Annie \nLennox, the Stereo MCs, Roni Size and Grace Jones. \nThe film stars Uma Thurman, Ralf Fiennes and Sean \nConnery.

Twenty-four-year-old White was recently hospitalised \nwith a serious stomach condition and is now recovering though it will take a \nnumber of months. It seems likely that Wall Of Sound will release a new \ntrack, 'Prop' featuring the Jungle Brothers, during that period as a single. \nAside from European dates and US commitments, the duo have been forced \nto cancel appearances at John Peel's Meltdown Festival on London's South \nBank as well as T In The Park in Glasgow. The Propellerheads' spokesperson \nsays, \"Both Alex and Will are bitterly disappointed but it's been a mad year.\" \nThe duo have sold more than 100,000 albums in the UK, 100,000 in \nAmerica and have had hit singles throughout Europe. @) \n5 6 Got the Feelin' 5ive \n6 8 Horny Mousse T v's ot'n'Juicy \n7 3 Sex on the Beach T·Spoon \n8 7 This Is '98 Asian \n9 Ghetto Superstar Pros Michel \nl 0 9 Gone 'til November Wydef Jean \n11 12 Truly Madly Deeply Savage Garden \n1 2 15 Stranded Lutricia McNeal \n13 17 Last Thing on my Mind Steps \n14 10 Diva Dana International \n15 13 Dance the Night Away Mavericks \n16 16 Whatever It Takes Sinead Lohan \n17 11 Feel It Tamperer \n18 14 Under the Bridge/LadyMarmalade All Saints \n19 19 Fight for yourRight (to Party}NYCC \n-- •• 20 23 Kung Fu Fighting Bus Stop \n= FFn F~-t~siN.&tESr~elHIR,--r -~L \n= ~~w ~d, , ' ' ' , ' I ' ' : ,,, I \n--r --·--1 1 \n- -, 2 \n·--·1· 3 \n= :=[ 4 \ni - -1 5 \n--.-6 \n---·-!· 7 \n=~ : -7 10 \n1 \n2 \n4 \n3 \n7 \n5 \n9 \n3 LIONS '98 Baddiel & Skinner \nVINDALOO Fat Les \nC'EST LA VIE B•witched \nGHmo SUPASTAR THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE \nPros Michel featuring ODB & MYA \nINTERGALACTIC Beastie Boys \nSAVE TONIGHT Eagle-Eye Cherry \nHORNY Mousse T Vs \nGOT THE FEELIN' \nHot'n'Juicy \nFive \nLOOKING FOR LOVE Karen Ramirez \nHOW DO YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU? \n=±::t] I l I I I I I ! l J j ! !

DROP \nreporter, Micheal Duffy went along to the show and spoke to the lads •••••••• \nDuring the first half of the 90's,An Emotional Fish were \none of the leading lights of the Irish music scene, synonymous \nwith great live shows and their big hit which still gets a regular \nairing on radio, 'Celebrate'. \nHowever after a couple of great singles from their third \nand last album 'Sloper', they slowly slipped from the limelight \nand out. the back door of the attention hotel. \nYet you felt a band who perform so enthusiastically on \nstage could not resist the lure of the live circuit for too long \nand sure enough Ger Whelan and the boys are back on the \nroad, and visited Limerick's newest live venue, The Warehouse \non Friday June 19th. \nRelaxing backstage before the gig, Whelan explained the \nbands notable absence of late. \"Basically, we weren't enjoying it \nat the time, and we felt we weren't doing what we wanted to \ndo. The corporate influences were a bit strong and things \nkinda came to a halt.\" \nBreaking free of the corporate shackles, Whelan is \nrivalling in the bands new role. \"I was fed up being the clown, \nnow I want to be the ringmaster\". \n\"We're fishing in the back waters at the moment, taking \na different approach. Our familiar songs are going to sound dif­\nferent live, and there will be a nucleus of \nesting for us and the audience.\" \nComeback tours are often a trip down memory lane, \nbut not this one. \"Some new material is already recorded and \nwe will be playing a lot of it at the gigs. We've also recorded an \nElvis cover for a charity album so listen out for that.\" \nThe .easy going atmosphere back stage was very appar­\nent as the -boys took to the stage. Kieran Kennedy, another \nfamilar face from the early nineties replaced guitarist Dave \nFrew for the gig and slotted in with ease. Right from the styl­\nish beginning of separately introducing \"our compare for the \nevening\" (Ger Whelan of course), the band performed with \nconfidence and surety, making it simple for the crowd to enjoy. \nIts clear to see that this is what An Emotional Fish do, \nand enjoy, best. Whelan comes alive on stage, a born frontman \nwhose enthusiasm and showmanship spreads to involve the \ncrowd. \nAll the new tracks went down well, especially \"A.F.C. \nWake up call\" ( the T-rex influence certainly noticeable), while \ndrop16 \nold favourites like_ 'Rain' and \"Blue' jogged \nthe memory. \nThe crowd waited for 'Celebrate' and \nwere not disappointed. The drum'n'bass \nversion teased, before the band obliged \nwith the more familiar version. The crowd \npredictably, celebrated. \nComebacks are often ridiculed, out of \nretirement as a means to an end is the \ngeneral consensus. An Emotional Fish dis­\nregard the cliches, and just delight in the \nfact that they are back, playing to what will \nbe appreciative crowds if the Limer:ick gig \nis anything to go by. @",

          "text": "ii \nI : \nI l ii \nl! ., \nI \nI \nSOCCER ROCKER \nIt has to be said that while this is proving to be a very \nentertaining World Cup, there has been goals a plenty \nand some neat skilful football but little by the way of \nDavid and Goliath style giant killings. Nigeria's defeat \nof Spain barely qualifies as Nigeria have been a dom­\ninant force in African football for many years now and \ndeclared to the world their intentions of kicking \nInternational ass back in USA '94 when they made it \nto the quarter finals. That's about it really .. unless you \ncount Iran beating the USA by two goals to one. Also \nthe days when the USA could be considered a Goliath \nof International football are many summers away. \nOtherwise any of the teams that one might have liked to \nsee topple one of the big boys have disappointed us as \nwell as themselves. Scotland showed that they simply don't \nhave it in crucial areas of the field. Their defence was too \nslow and tired by the time the nifty little Moroccans made \nshreds of it and the Scots lacked any cohesive punch up \nfront either. Jamaica's Reggae Boyz showed that all the \nheart and will to win in the World won't help if your team \nlacks basic football cop -on. Although they weren't \nhelped by a fussy ref dismissing one of their players early \non in their dash with Argentina. \nThere might be substance to the theory that there's one law \nfor the big boys and another law for the underdogs in that \nI've seen several minor image tackles -two by Italians, one \nby the English and another Brazilian one -totally ignored \nby the officials. \nCameroon, I thought had considerably less luck tan they \nhad talent. Though well beaten by the Italians they could \nand should have secured a place in the second round but \nhad what looked like a legitimate goal, disallowed in their \n1-1 draw with Chile. Consequently it will have been an \ndrop18 \nadmittedly useful looking Chile who had the snot kicked off \nthem by Brazil last Saturday week (I'm sticking my head \nout here again ... l'm writing this on the Wednesday prior to \nthe Chile Vrs Brazil game .) \nSo by the time this brand new \"DROP\" is piping hot off the \npress we'll be down to the last fo~r and the usua~ s~spects \nare already lining up to book their places and this Is \nbefore the group stage is over at all. \nDespite their Norwegian hiccup, I expect that Brazil will \nstill be there which will mean that they fought off Nigeria's \nSuper Eagles at the quarter finals stage. Italy being the \npoxy shower of gits that they' re will probably still be there \ntoo via a few penalty shoot outs -probably dumping the \nexciting host team of France out at the same stage. I'd like \nto think that my pre-tournament bet, Holland will still be \nthere too though they'll have to cross swords with their old \nnemesis the Germans en route. \nAt this point in time the team looking most likely to go all \nthe way from what I've seen, is Argentina. This I don't \nmind at all as I'll have £35 coming to me in a gentleman's \nwager if the Argies go all the way . They've shown that \nthey've the right blend of South American flair, North \nEuropean robust tackling and Mediterranean acting skills \nessential for winning those free kicks-to take them to the \nfinals. Also they have at least two lads, Batistuta and \nOrtega who know how to stick a ball in the back of the net \nand with frightening regularity as poor auld Jamaica will \ntestify. \nAnd finally what of England?? Sure haven't I just said \nArgentina will be there so we'll have waved bye bye to \nGlen Hoddle's boys at the airport quite a while ago. We'll \nhave newly Crowned World Champions by the next time, \nso till then!! @ • \nI \nr-",

          "text": "WHAT'S THIS, A CHANCE TO HITCH A RIDE IN A \nMCIAREN AND YET HOSS CARNEY FIRMLY REFUSES. \nHE MUST BE MAD .... \nIn this age of chemical elements, weights and measures \nand God awful post-modern rationalist thinking its good to \nknow that despite all of Mclaren's obvious dull adherence to \nthe rules of straight-laced competitive hard graft, there are \nstill members of that organisation who like to occasionally \nattack their work from a lateral -even madcap -plateau. \nThe evidence of which is the brand new Mclaren MP4/98T -\na two seater Formula one car. Now for those of us who love \nGrand Prix racing but have so far been entirely unsuccessful \nin attracting the collective eye of Formula One's various team \nmanagers or in even acquiring the very basic necessity of an \nFIA approved racing-licence this might just be a case of Ron \nDennis and Co . (the head guy at you know who) making our \nstep up from super-mini to super-car that bit easier. Why so? \nWell, because Mclaren, in all their glorious Mercedes funded \nwisdom, have decided that a certain member of the anony­\nmous public shall get a chance to strap themselves into this \ncar, to hold on tight and to get hurled around Silverstone in \nwhat has to be the world's most expensive taxi and all with­\nout he or she footing any sort of bill, tab or debt. \nIn association with Autosport magazine (avail­\nable from Easons of Patrick street or Gleesons of Glentworth \nstreet) Mclaren are running a simple postal competition \nwhereby we -the anonymous public -buy a copy of \nAutosport, write our name and address onto a specially \nenclosed postcard (which the magazine supplies), mail the \npostcard and hey presto a couple of weeks later Mika \nHakkinen rings up telling us we've won the trip of a life time \nand that Ron Dennis is looking forward to our visit. Couldn't \nbe more simple. Then again so is the Lotto but as yet I \nhaven't had any call to celebrate that either. Yet I'd be a fool \nto discount chance entirely, certain Satanic Cults and dodgy \nSooth Sayers have promised that with enough self mutilation, \ndegradation and the odd large donation to their always \nshort of the final figure building funds, our prayers, or \nshould that not be our post cards, will be answered. With \nwhat though, junk mail from Mclaren H.Q. entreating us to \ncomfort disappointment with a David Coulthard lamp shade \nor even a Mika Hakkinen commemorative soup ladel? I don't \nthink so. The fact of the matter is I stand the same chance as \neveryone else in this competition, which when the Abacus of \nLife finally Rickers to a standstill works out as pretty much \ndiddly squat. \nNo, despite all my admiration for Ron and his team's \nwacky two seater, I can't bring myself to enter his generously \noffered competition. Its one thing not to win a million squids \nevery third or fourth evening, but to have my one and only \nchance of ever sitting behind the wheel of an active contem­\nporary Formula One car (well I would be behind the driver \nand he'd be in front of the wheel) missing out on something \nas cool as this would be too much. Much too much . I'd pre­\nfer to read about John Nobody from Nothingham who \n'SUCCEEDED IN LAST WEEKS COMPETITION, WELL \nDONE JOHN' and to sit back in the sure knowledge that I \nwasn't in so I couldn't have won. And not being in I could \nhave no regrets, and having no regrets would ensure I \ncould forget the whole matter and in so forgetting I could \ncarry on with my life almost perfectly ignorant of that which \nI could never have had in the First place - a trip 'round the \nblock in a Mclaren. Now you may take exception to my \nlogic, you may even disagree with my pessimism, but I'd \nwager a month of \nyou're own income that no one from Limerick is going to \nwin. I guess, when all is said and won, this is just another \ncase of God awful post-modern rationalist thinking over­\ncoming my latenf lateral madcapness. I almost feel sorry for \nmyself. But for those of you with a bit more Romance in \nyou' re bones don't forget its Autosport Easons and \nGleesons and its off the shelves come Friday. I guess all \nthat's left to say is good luck, and lots of it, 'cause For sure \nyou'll damn well need it! @) • \nHANRATTYS \nEXCLUSIVE NITE CLIJB \nIRISH MUSIC \nTHURSDAY NIGHT \nFRIDAY NIGHT \nHANRA TTYS HOTEL \nGLENTWORTH STREET \n(061) 410999 \nID£RICCIE ®® 9~ 9 i®9~ 9 ffi®9~o \ndrop19",

          "text": "wheels \nof steel \nThe Tour Turns Green \nMichael Lehane covers the Tour De France '98 ....... . \nSporting success has rained down on Ireland with a sweet fre­\nquency over the last ten years but the first memory of this \ngolden age was the image of Stephen Roche winning the Tour \nDe France in 1987. Back then Ireland was at the centre of this \nwonderful sport. Sean Kelly was always in the world's top \ntwo world cycling rankings. Roche had his record equalling \ntrilogy of wins in 1987. Martin Early was arguably the finest \nnon team leader cycling at the time and Paul Kimmage was \nblossoming into a fine professional rider. \nToday there is no Irish rider in the Continental Pro Peloton, Roche \nand Kelly have joined the list of former greats. Martin Early has \nbecome a mountain bike rider. Paul Kimmage is a journalist iso­\nlated from the sport he loves because of his courage to write a \nbook highlighting the dominance of drugs in cycling. The \nFederation of Irish cycling is a highly politicised body with \ndisharmony never too far from the surface. However the FIC has \na charismatic president in Pat McQuaid, the man who has done \nthe most to bring the Tour De France to Ireland. \nMcQuaid and Alan Ruston, his partner in L'Evenement (The com ­\npany organising the Tour in Ireland), have managed to secure \nfor Ireland it's biggest sports event ever. They were assisted by \nthe Dublin International Sports Council and also by the govern­\nment in making a case to have the tour here. Another important \nfactor was the support of the current race director, Jean Marie \nLeblanc, who covered the Nissan Classic in 1985 and 1986, \nhere he \"saw a lively race in a part of the world he hadn't seen \nbefore\". \nThe Tour will begin in Dublin on the 11th of this month with a \nPrologue (Time Trial) which will start outside Trinity College. It \nwill then weave its way through Nassau street, Stephen's Green \nand under Christ Church before finishing outside the GPO . This \nis a short circuit and a good braking will be as important as \nspeed for the riders here. \nStage one takes place the following day and will stretch over a \ndistance of 180.5km. It will begin at the GPO, but will be neu­\ntralised until Dundrum, here the real start commences. The Tour \nthen travels down to Arklow before turning up to Avoca, \nBlessington and Tallaght and it will finish up in the Pheonix park \nat around 4pm, 4 hours and 2o minutes after its start. \nThe second stage will leave Enniscorthy at 9am and travel along \nthe South coast during the 205.5 KM journey. This is an \nextremely difficult stage which encorporates the Sean Kelly sprint \nwhich will happen just after the climb of Carrick-on-Suir. The \nstage finishes at Victoria Cross in Cork. This stage should set the \nscene for the dominant riders to emerge. These riders include, \nRilis and Ullrich the winners of the last two tours. Then there are \nthe climbers like Zulle who is very good on the mountains. A fit \nOlano could pose a threat and the race is also very suited to a \nrider like Casagrande and don't forget Jalabert. \nIreland is well set to produce some really good racing according \nto Stephen Roche, \"The roads are narrow but it will be the first \ntime the riders haven't had to deal with round about\" So ironi­\ncally Ireland will have the safest touring roads. The roads should \nEscartin -one of the Tour's Climbers \nalso add excitement to the race because \"they are twisty which \nwill make it difficult for any team to organise a chase.\" Roche \nsaid. \nThere is a whole plethora of facts concerning the size of the tour \nbut if we just consider a few it will reAect the scale of the project. \nThree ships will help to carry the tour back to France from Cork. \nThere are also three chartered planes flying from Cork to Brest on \nthe return journey. There are 3500 accredited race personnel, \n1500 journalists, 200 photographers, 22 teams with nine riders \neach, 40 Gendarmerie assisted by l 000 Gardai and there will \nbe 104 broadcasting units following the race. The tour is expect­\ned to contribute £30 million to the economy. \nWhatever your interest in cycling, the atmosphere surrounding \nthe Tour's Ireland stages is sure to engulf you. So if you want to \nappear wise say convincingly that : \"Cipollini will win the first \nstage and Erik Zabel will win in Cork while Boardman and \nUllrich will do well in the time trial.\".@ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the tour de france \nin Ireland \ndrop20 \n(",

          "text": "(,'_'R_E_-_c_o_o_P_E_R_-A_T=~=D_\" __ ) \nRonan Hennessy talks to local band \"Mysteries End \" \nin the return of the Limrock profiles. \nIn the insane \nclash of entities \nthat is \n\"Limrock\" only \nthose most \nenduring and \nprogressive \ncome to m ind. \n\"Mysteries End\" \nare a band who \nsuitably fit this \ncategory. In a \ntruthful analysis \ntheir music \nmaybe too dis­\ntinct for a self \ncontented local \nmusic scene. They are destined for much greater things. \nThe original line up of the band was formed in early '95 with \nGary Cooper on vocals. Their present vocalist and former gui­\ntarist Steve Fitz tells me that they originally started w ith a \nmelodic metal sound and following this, a string of early suc­\ncesses including reaching the semi-final of a local band com ­\npetition. They promptly recorded their first demo in Xeric stu­\ndios during the Summer of '96 with everyone contributing to \nthe bass tracks due to the· absence of a bass player. \nPossibly their greatest achievement though was the recording \nin Dublin of their perennial epic \"Starscorned\" included on the \nIrish metal compilation. This release gave the band the desired \nexposure which they backed up with a promotional gig in \nDublin venue, Slattery's where Steve explains they were very \nwell received. That was a hectic day for the band with appear­\nances in both Limerick and Dublin. They started with the music \nexpo in Arthur's Quay Park joined by over twenty other Limerick \nbands. These events were to be a turning point for the band \nwho realised their true potential would be found in a change of \nstyle. The departure of Gary Cooper m~ant Steve Fitz becan:ie \nthe band's vocalist. The current line-up Is as follows, Steve Fitz \nis on vocals, Alan O 'Connell on guitar, Sean O 'Brien on bass \nand Keith McCoy on drums. \nSteve attributes the diverse musical influences, ranging from \nFaith No More to Cannibal Corpse, to the line-up change . It \nwould therefore be difficult to pigeon hole the band's music due \nto the many complexities involved, but somehow I would \ndescribe it as improvised, operatic metal. \nThere are however many certainties about the band, for exa~­\nple their music's intoxicating nature and als? the fact that their \ndrummer Keith McCoy is without exaggeration one of the best \ndrummers I have ever seen or heard perform. \nAs well as older songs such as \"Starscorned\" and \"My _ Velvet \nCreation\" their current repertoire includes new songs like the \npowerful \"Cutting Edge\" and even a few acoustic numbers such \nas \"Sometimes\". With this whole new element a successful \ncomeback seems assured when play Costelloe's on \nWednesday, July 8th. \"My Friend Judas\". playing a_s support \nshould make he night a worthy of a mark m _y~ur ~Iary. \n\"As far as playing in Limerick, you're pretty limited , says Steve, \n\"There is definitely a lack of proper venues, bands should be \ndrop21 \ncatered for more professionally\" \nJudging by their musical credentials alone and not on any other \npretence , this Mysteries End gig is not to be missed by any \nself-respecting music lover. The band intend to record the per­\nformance for demo purposes. They will try and capture the \nessence of live performances on the recording -something that \nis difficult to convey in studio demos . This should help bring \nincreased recognition of the band's progression since the \nadvent of new material and the recent line-up change. \n\"Limrock\" continues, so catch it while it's hot. \nMysteries End play with My Friend Judas, July the eighth at \nCostelloe's. Admission is free and the doors open at eight o' \nclock. \nIf you are in a local band and would like to be included in the \n\"Limrock\" profiles send information, contact numbers and /or a \ndemo for the band to DROP Magazine 67-68 Catherine Street \nLimerick. \nThe first of a number of features on essential releases \nof the 1990's by Ollie Gleeson ..... \n\" . \n-■a~ \n....,..;,,,,;-.,.,,...._/·\\:r · . \n/ ' .. ;' - • • • • dl99J't:rt:i1r~·~c., \n,.!,_·, ,· •.•.• ... __:•_ •• :. , ,;f, . \nCRACKER : KEROSENE HAT. \nWhen David Lowery's 'Camper Van Beethoven' crashed on tour \nin 1989, he needed a new vehicle to carry his skewed philoso­\nphy to the world. To this end he set up Cracker with his long \ntime friend John Hickman. From 1992 to 1996 they released \nthree albums: Cracker, Kerosene Hat and·The Golden Age but \nin a sense Cracker's 'golden age' arrived with the release of \nKerosene Hat. \nLowery never lost the eccentricities of his Camper Van days \nand this is obvious by the fact that this CD carries an amazing \n99 tracks, most of which however consist only of three sec­\nonds of silence. Lost amongst the static is track 88, Eurotrash \nG irls with a wit and a chorus which will stay with you long \nafter.Pee Pee and Poo Poo have gone to bed. The two singles \n\"Low\" and \"Get Off This\" along with the caustic \"Movie Star'' are \ngrunge laden and paranoid yet rest comfortably alongside the \ninfectious country nonsense of \"Sweet Potato\" and the epic gui­\ntar ballad \"I Want Everything\" (what Counting Crows' \nWalkaways would sound like if they ever finished it.) Throw in a \nGrateful Dead cover i.e. \"Loser'' and a 40 second slice of distor­\ntion i.e. Hi-Desert Biker Meth Lab (basically some nutter with a \nhammer who falls asleep!) and you have one of the most \nessential albums of the Nineties. @)",

      "raw_text": "WHAT'S THIS, A CHANCE TO HITCH A RIDE IN A \nMCIAREN AND YET HOSS CARNEY FIRMLY REFUSES. \nHE MUST BE MAD .... \nIn this age of chemical elements, weights and measures \nand God awful post-modern rationalist thinking its good to \nknow that despite all of Mclaren's obvious dull adherence to \nthe rules of straight-laced competitive hard graft, there are \nstill members of that organisation who like to occasionally \nattack their work from a lateral -even madcap -plateau. \nThe evidence of which is the brand new Mclaren MP4/98T -\na two seater Formula one car. Now for those of us who love \nGrand Prix racing but have so far been entirely unsuccessful \nin attracting the collective eye of Formula One's various team \nmanagers or in even acquiring the very basic necessity of an \nFIA approved racing-licence this might just be a case of Ron \nDennis and Co . (the head guy at you know who) making our \nstep up from super-mini to super-car that bit easier. Why so? \nWell, because Mclaren, in all their glorious Mercedes funded \nwisdom, have decided that a certain member of the anony­\nmous public shall get a chance to strap themselves into this \ncar, to hold on tight and to get hurled around Silverstone in \nwhat has to be the world's most expensive taxi and all with­\nout he or she footing any sort of bill, tab or debt. \nIn association with Autosport magazine (avail­\nable from Easons of Patrick street or Gleesons of Glentworth \nstreet) Mclaren are running a simple postal competition \nwhereby we -the anonymous public -buy a copy of \nAutosport, write our name and address onto a specially \nenclosed postcard (which the magazine supplies), mail the \npostcard and hey presto a couple of weeks later Mika \nHakkinen rings up telling us we've won the trip of a life time \nand that Ron Dennis is looking forward to our visit. Couldn't \nbe more simple. Then again so is the Lotto but as yet I \nhaven't had any call to celebrate that either. Yet I'd be a fool \nto discount chance entirely, certain Satanic Cults and dodgy \nSooth Sayers have promised that with enough self mutilation, \ndegradation and the odd large donation to their always \nshort of the final figure building funds, our prayers, or \nshould that not be our post cards, will be answered. With \nwhat though, junk mail from Mclaren H.Q. entreating us to \ncomfort disappointment with a David Coulthard lamp shade \nor even a Mika Hakkinen commemorative soup ladel? I don't \nthink so. The fact of the matter is I stand the same chance as \neveryone else in this competition, which when the Abacus of \nLife finally Rickers to a standstill works out as pretty much \ndiddly squat. \nNo, despite all my admiration for Ron and his team's \nwacky two seater, I can't bring myself to enter his generously \noffered competition. Its one thing not to win a million squids \nevery third or fourth evening, but to have my one and only \nchance of ever sitting behind the wheel of an active contem­\nporary Formula One car (well I would be behind the driver \nand he'd be in front of the wheel) missing out on something \nas cool as this would be too much. Much too much . I'd pre­\nfer to read about John Nobody from Nothingham who \n'SUCCEEDED IN LAST WEEKS COMPETITION, WELL \nDONE JOHN' and to sit back in the sure knowledge that I \nwasn't in so I couldn't have won. And not being in I could \nhave no regrets, and having no regrets would ensure I \ncould forget the whole matter and in so forgetting I could \ncarry on with my life almost perfectly ignorant of that which \nI could never have had in the First place - a trip 'round the \nblock in a Mclaren. Now you may take exception to my \nlogic, you may even disagree with my pessimism, but I'd \nwager a month of \nyou're own income that no one from Limerick is going to \nwin. I guess, when all is said and won, this is just another \ncase of God awful post-modern rationalist thinking over­\ncoming my latenf lateral madcapness. I almost feel sorry for \nmyself. But for those of you with a bit more Romance in \nyou' re bones don't forget its Autosport Easons and \nGleesons and its off the shelves come Friday. I guess all \nthat's left to say is good luck, and lots of it, 'cause For sure \nyou'll damn well need it! @) • \nHANRATTYS \nEXCLUSIVE NITE CLIJB \nIRISH MUSIC \nTHURSDAY NIGHT \nFRIDAY NIGHT \nHANRA TTYS HOTEL \nGLENTWORTH STREET \n(061) 410999 \nID£RICCIE ®® 9~ 9 i®9~ 9 ffi®9~o \ndrop19",

She toured extensively in Europe , America , Africa, Asia and Australia. \n0\n1 \nhing unusual about that you might say except it took fifty to seventy days to get to Australia in those days by sailing ship and just \nas ong to get fro~ New York t? San ~rancis~o by horse and carriage. In 1847 Catherine Ha yes gave £10,000 to the Bishop of Limerick \nfr?m ~lobal earmngs to help with famme rehef and on her death in 1865 she left an estate of £16,000. She sang in The \nL1menck Athenaeumthat had just cost the hug·e sum of £500 to build. \nN~xt up was Joseph O 'Mara. He st~rted hi~ career in a supporting role to Miss Anna Russell. He was one of the first people to have his \nvoice recorded. He also went on to mternational stardom. He played his first concert in the Lim erick Athenaeum in 1889 before he was \nf~~u~ and played there several times afterwards. Other famous people to make a noise in Th e Limerick Athenaeum include famine \npoliticians and one oflrelands exports to Australia, William Smith O 'Brien. He spoke in 1857 after his release. Then we had J.F . \nMaguire , Isaac Butt, Charles Stewart Par­\nnell, Mr. Davitt, Miss Sheehy-Skeffington, \nMaud Gonne , Padrig Pearse and Roger \nCasement . Also in 1900 the citzens of the \nCity and County gathered to send an \naddress of welcome to Queen Victoria, So all \nin all the place has been very busy.Did \nMulti-media begin with W . Percy French in \nDec. 1895 with his state of the art Oxy­\nHydrogen Lantern othenvise known as \n\"Magic Lantern\"? \nMulti-Media began much earlier on in the \nmid 1800s in the Limerick Athenaeum , \npainted panoramas and various objects \nwere exhibited with noise in the back­\nground which became popularley known as \nXERIC STUDIOS PRESENTS \nThe Cranberries \nA Touch of Oliver \nThe Charming \nRoyal Theatre \nSaturday, 21st December, \n1991 \nPrice £3.00 £4.00 at Door \nmusic. Some of the paintings exhibited in· \nthe Athenaeum at that time were by \nbreaking artists such as Rembrant , \nRoubin s, Carravagio, Turn er, Purcer and \nR eynolds. Some of the objects they \ndisplayed included a machin e just devel-\noped by a Mr . Edison. This machine had a \ndisc that spun and when you placed a \nneedle on it, it m ade a noise similar to \npeople singing or playing instruments, \nhard to know what kind of future this \ninstrument could have. \nNext up in 1905 supporting a hero called \nAlf Hurley was a fella called John F . \nM cCormack , his career did not effectively \nstart until 1906. So the first time he \n------------------J properly appeared on a billing in his own \nname was at the Limerick Athenaeum if only in a supporting role. Mr . McCormaclz also played here after he was famous. Mr . M cCor­\nmack also toured the world extensivley, was made a papel Count in 1927. H e was the first Irish artist to make good use of Mr. Edison's \ninvention, he sold millions of records all over the world. He sold more records and recieved more airplay then any Irish Artist between \n1900 and 1980 . He was also the first Irish artist to make a movie . Ireland's first global superstar and first lady to develop the Irish \nDiaspora Catherine Hayes sang here in 1857. Visual arts from painted panoramas to. the first projected pictures with the aid of our pow­\nerful Oxy-Hydrogen 'magic ' lantern were shown here in the mid 1800's. Mr . Edisons first sound machine was exhibited here in the \n1870's, Limerick's first recording star Joseph O 'Mara got his first support slot here in the 1880's. Th e first moving pictures were shown \nhere in the 1890's. The first Irish recording superstar to make good use of Mr . Ed ison's invention Count John McCormack sang here in \na s~pporting role in 1905. The following year he was signed to the Edison-Bell \nRecording Company . He sang his first concert in the Athaneum 90 years ago this year and died in September 50 years ago this year. \nWe unfortunately don't have enough space left to do justice to the various activities of the Athenaeum for the last six years, except to \nsay that Tuesday Blue the first Limerick band to recieve a world wide record deal performed herein 1989. The first home produced \nrec~rded album of 15 Limerick bands called the Reindeer Age was performed here live in 1990. In 1991 we had our first concert with \nThe Cranberries. In 1992 a young girl sat in a Limerick theatre watching som e band s up on stage and feeling restless she t~ed to her \nfriend and said \"Everybody else is doing it, so why can't we?\" This innocent question has become the anthem of the arts industry in the \n~-------....,. Ireland of the 1990's. Last year 2 of the acts that played Woodst~ck, the largest festi~al in the ':orld'. played here. 13 of the act.s that \nI ed Feile the largest in Europe, played here.

          "raw_text": "Thursday April 27th -Wednesday May 10th• LI I ERIC l EV EN TS IU IDE \nSunday 26 April. 2.30pm . I'm writing on the afternoon of \nthe BIG GAME. I can think of little else. Limerick are just \none m~asly win away from a promotion play off. For all . \nof ye out there in L.E.G. Reader Land who are just plain \nignorant, here's what's happening : Limerick are fourth \nin Division One with just one game left in the League at \nhome against Finn Harps. Finn Harps are in third with a \nbetter goal difference. We must beat Finn Harps, we sim­\nply must, and I can just picture the sly shower o'hoors \narriving down from Donegal and playing as negatively as \npossible because all they need is a point to secure third \nplace. The way the promotion/relegation thing works \nis ... The bottom two in the Premier Division (Monaghan \nUTD .and C?bh Ramblers) automatically go down to \nDivision One and the top two in Division One (UCO and \nDrogheda) go up. Then, third from the bottom of the Pre-\n' mier Division (Athlone Town) have to 'play-off' against \nDivision One's third placed side over two legs and that \nfolks, is where Limerick comes in_ .... but only if we send \nFinn Hai:ps back to Donegal with a hiding they'll not for­\nget for a while. Actually it doesn't have to be a hiding at \nall. Any mangy ould win will do just fine and Limerick \nare more than capable of delivering the goods . Finn \nHarps on the other hand, while being a fine team, are \nshowing some end of season jitters. They went down 0-1 \nat home to UCO last Sunday while Limerick were out-\nBrought to you by the \nMan-in-the-Know, Rocking' \nHitcher himself, \nNiall Quinn ... \nclassing Kilkenny City 3-0 with Anthony Tobin \ngrabbing two in the first half and Steven Holt \nadding a third near the end. Anyway, l'll finish \nthis report once the result is known ... I'll proba­\nbly write it in the p\\lb where I'll either be in cele­\nbratory form, leading a resounding chorus of \n\"Finn Harps are the wankers in your neighbour­\nhood !! In your neighbourhood!! In your neigh­\nbour-hoo-ood!!\" or I'll be sitting quietly in a \ndarkened comer sobbing into my fifteenth pint. \n.... 5.30pm. AAaaww · shit! 0-0. Limerick threw \neverything at Finn Harps but had no luck. Their \ncause wasn't helped much by a referee who spent the after­\nnoon doing a fine Louis Armstrong impersonation with his \nwhistle and pissing everyone off at the same time. The guy \nhad to have a police escort leaving the pitch. He wa s terri­\nble. Just about everybody got a yellow card. Lim erick \ndefender, Steven Craig, wa s sent off for God only know s \nwhat. Limerick had pleas for a clear penalty ignored, Noe l \nKing was ordered out of the dugout and the biggest crowd \nat Hogan Park this season got it dead right -Th e referee is \nindeed a wanker! \nSo, that's the end of Limer ick's season . Th ey finished \nfourth ... with the same number of points as Finn H arps \nbut, as previously explained, Finn Harp s have a better goal \ndifference. Still, there's always next season!!. \n' .-\nSPORT \nLlmerlclr. F .C . before their game againat Finn Harps \nat Rathbane \n• There's a heavy paranoia vibe emmanating from the \nfootball press about Wednesdays game against Portugal \nin Dublin. They seem to think we'll be lucky to get a \ndraw and they also keep referring to 'Black Wednesday ' \n(13 Oct 1993), the day that Ireland lost 3-1 in Dublin to \nSpain. But vV hat these learned football scribes seem to \nhave forgotten is that WE AREN 'T PLAYING AGAINST \nSPAIN - we 're playing Portugal!! Wake up lads!! Cop \non!

Comprised of lead \nsinger Diarmuid O'Sullivan, guitarist Hugh \nMulqueen, bassist Brian Corr and drummer Willie \nBanks, 'Oliver' were brought together from the \nbroken fragments of other aspiring groups in St. \nMunchins College, Corbally, in 1990. Their com­\nmon love for the music of R.E.M. was a very \nimportant unifying factor and also provided the \nbasis for their own sound. \n\"We w ere totally crap in the beginning, it was only after \nm onths of practising together that things started to \nw ork,\" says Diarmu id . \nTh e band built up a very strong local following in Limer­\nick and as a result impressed the likes of An Emotional \nFish and Something Happens , so m uch so that they \noffered them supp ort slots on their respective tours. \n\"Our biggest gig ever was the SFX in Dublin,\" says \nDiarmuid. \"I couldn't believe we we re playing the \nsam e arena that R.E.M . had played before.\" \nIt w as a five track dem o recorded at Lim erick's Xeric Stu­\ndios in 1992 that set label-signing in sight of the Limerick \nhopefuls. Ye t even w hile contract offers from som e of the \ncountry's better known record com panies began flooding \nin, the band adm itted having several reservations about \nsigning on the dotted line. \n\"We felt that they were going to use us like they did a lot \nof other Irish band s in the past so w e politely told them \n'thanks but no thanks'.\" \nLimerick journalist, Shane Foley, w as responsible for giv­\ning the group the direction they needed. H e passed on their \ndem o to Bnr/None R ecords m ainm an T om Prendergast \n(featured in Issue 23) wh en he visited the country from \nNew York in 1992. After listening to the tape during the \njourney home , the story goes that Tom was filled with tears \nand offered the group a contrae:t immediately on arrival to \nJfK. It was a contract that seemed to suit all. Tom gave his \npermission to have a fully fledged album recorded at the \ncity's Xeric Studio, laying down no actual deadline \nmuch to the band's astonishm ent. \n\"It was great because one wee k we could go in and record, \nthe next week we could take a break,\" says Diarmu id. \nPierce Gilmore engineered the album with the band \nthem selves lending a helping hand and, according to D iar­\nmuid, all w ere pleased w ith and proud of the final product. \nH o w eve r, as is so o ften the case am on g fledgling \nrock'n'rollers, the lack of overall comm itment saw the \nband finally silencing instruments in Autumn 1993, only \ngetting together briefly the following year to prom ote the \nrelease of their album which w as being m arketed exclu­\nsively in the U.S. From there they strolled their separate \nw ays : Drum mer Wi llie Banks found his feet as a busi­\nness m anager with a com pany in Ru ssia, of all places, \nBrian becam e involved in the lnsh film industry w hile \nHu gh returned hom e and still continues to w ork in \nLimerick. \nYe t To uch of Oliver are not completely dead. Diar-L \nmuid, though living in Limerick at the momen t, hc1s \nplans to settle back m the States this summ er, with fur­\nther plans of a possible return to the mu sic business. It \nis a possibility that would excite man y of the band 's \nloya l fans. T he group's first album assault on the \nrecord-buying public wa s a noted gem , going beyond \nthe norm of a sim ple collection of pop songs. From the \nacoustic pleasance of My C ube to the experimental \nW eight, the album is recomm ended , and fans of Th e \nC ranberries should know that Do lores O 'R iordan \nalso m akes an app earance on the haunting Cnro11 sel. \n\"I ma y get a band together m the States using the nam e \nTo uch of O liver, and bring out som e new m aterial,\" \nDiarmuid reveals. \nH e m ay do . And if he does, ,n actual fact it really \nwo uldn't be that much of a surprise. Rather, it will be \njust another continuing chapter of the story that Is Lim -\nerick and M usic. \n1 \n(The album is available from Black Spot Re cords, \nGolden Discs or by mail order to Bar/None P.O .

Well. it's basically a Lon­\ndon-based record label that provides a platform for \n• experimental hip hop . \nIt was set up a few years ago by James Lavelle and the British \nmus ic media have already been gasping a bout its brilliance. \nThankfully its reign as flavour of the m onth has since given way \nto something else (like the new wave o f new wa ve or the great \nmod revival), but the term ·trip hop ' is still beinp used to label a \nform of music that has always refused to rema in within these \nboundaries. Lavelle and co. prefer the term 'Head Music', and \nthis is indeed a more accurate way to describe a genre that's so \nheavily influenced by the smok y beats of hip hop . The most \nimpressive thing about Mo 'Wax is it's tenden cy to take a difterenr \napproach to the ever evolving format of hip hop . \nThus we 've got the laidback and thought-provoking r.aps of Black­\nalicious. the epic jazz journeys of DJ Shadow and the booming \nbeats of La Funk Mob . \nAlthough Mo 'Wa x w a s not necessarily the first label to instigate \nPage~, \nMUSIC \nBy Stephen Grainger \nth \nalternative take o n hip hop, it has spawned many imita­\ntors, and now hardly a month goes by without some dif-\n. ferent record label releasing a chill-out album. \nThis 1s no bad thing and Jam On It! has been at pains to \nemphasis the strength of much of these records over the \nl~st few months . Anyway, it should be an interesting \nnight. Anyone coming down for it should check out the \nDonkeys Ea~s pub on Un ion Quay beforehand. where \nyours truly will be spinning the best in Mo 'Wax , and \n~here the opportunity of winning FREE tickets to the gig \nIs a possibility \n.•• Jazz ~nthusiasts will be Impressed with the release of \nJazz Jwce 2 • on Beechwood as part of the new Street­\n~ounds series.

Most of all, we're \nalways eager to shout loud about areas of art oth­\ners seem to pass over in favour of a more traditional \nart 'purity' (such as painting and sculpture). So it \nshouldn't seem strange that the Belltable Arts \nCentre, O 'Connell Street, and the Dolmen \nGallery. Honan 's Quay , are two of 43 venues \nnationwide, taking part in the first ever Print Cel-\nebration, a fine art print festival due to be \nlaunched this May . Coordinated by The Print \nInitiative (a group of studios, artists and promo­\ntional agencies run by Temple Bar Properties), this \ncountrywide month-long exhibition will provide a \nmuch needed opportunity to see new work by \nsome of the finest contemporary Irish printmakers, \nas well as the print collections of both Arts Council, \nTrinity College Dublin, Irish Life pie, the Office of \nPublic Works , the Bank of Ireland and AIB .. In Limer­\nick, 26 of the city's printmakers will be presenting \nworks, their names reading like a 'who 's who ' of \nnationally acclaimed artists, with Charles Harp-\ner, Gavin Hogg, Tim Humphries, \nYvonne Sweeney, Ronan Sexton, Des \nMcMahon, Suzannah O'Reilly, David \nLilburn, Samuel Walsh, Michael Can­\nning and Dan Kenny only some of the impres­\nsive many .Their contribution to this exhibition can \nonly help to further the Print Initiative's overall ambi-\ntions which are to create the first ever database of \nIrish printmakers, double the numbe r of national \nvenues whe re print is regularly exhibited and to \neducate the general public on the specialised \ntechniques of printmaking.

      "chunk_text": "Ape Invasion \nIn Somalia it has been report­\ned that a schoolboy football \nteam had to abandon a match \nafter a pitch invasion. \nUnfortunately the invasion was­\nn't of ecstatic fans but of mad \nmonkeys. Witnesses said the \nmonkeys invaded the pitch in \nBurao town and attacked the \nplayers, biting and scratching \nyoungsters on the legs.The \ntown of Burao is home to as \nmany monkeys as it is people, \nduring Somalia's Civil war \nloads of the monkeys took over \nderelict buildings with the result \nthat some parts of Burao are \nnow home to colonies of \nMonkeys. The Monkey invasion \nof the pitch is not unusual in \nthe area and armed police \nwere on hand to disperse the \nprimates. The monkeys would­\nn't relent until their ring leader \nwas shot dead by police marks­\nmen!!. \nRussia Frenzy for Fish bait \nBarbie! \nIn Far Eastern Russia, fisher­\nmen have now begun a frenzy \nof purchasing Barbie dolls!! Not \nbecause they have just begun \nto find their sensitives sides or \nbecause US consumerism has \ngotten a grip of them but \nbecause their hair makes good \nfish bait! Fishermen have been \nbuying up Chinese-made \nBarbie dolls and using their \ngolden hair as bait. Some \nFishermen have been quoted \nas saying that the hair is very \npopular with the local fish. The \nproblem for the US manufactur­\ners is that they are not cashing \nin on the fad because the \nFishermen are not purchasing \nI \noriginal products but rather \ncheap imitations from China. \nCat shortage puts rats on the \nmenu \nIn Vietnam the population is \nbeing instructed to stop eating \nCats and switch ... to eating rats. \nA Irish reader who 's used to the \nbacon, cabbage and spuds may \nfind it hard to comprehend but in \nother parts of the world where \nspuds and bacon are not as \ncommon and people wouldn't \ndare eat cabbage -small ani­\nmals are the only option. The \ncat meat trade in Vietnam is a \ngrowing trade and even within \nVietnam the export trade of cats \nto China is becoming a lucrative \nbusiness, That was until the \ngovernment outlawed the eating \nof Cats so as to prevent an over \nrun of rats in the region. It \nappears as if the country was \nsuffering from an excessive \nnumber of rats running freely in \nthe city. This is leading to the \ndestruction of many harvests \nand the agriculture section is \nsuffering badly so now with the \neating of cats outlawed many of \nthe countries natives are turning \nto the plentiful supply of Rats to \nnourish themselves. The eating \nof rats is already common prac­\ntice so the transition from cats \nto rats will not be so hard felt. \nVery Cold Turkey \nTwo young romantics in Turkey \ngot a hard taste of reality when \ntheir elopement went tragically \nwrong. The couple Reis Mergen \nand girlfriend Ali Dogan were \nfleeing from their families in the \nname of love, however what \nthey didn't bank on was ending \nITTews \nup together in a hospital bed \nminus hands and feet -not \neven able to hug each other. \nWhat happened wasn't some \nTurkish law that made elope­\nment punishable by amputation \nof hands and feet but rather in \nthe escape attempt the couple \nended up fleeing across the \ncountry side on foot (later to be \nlost). Unfortunately for the duo \nheavy snow began to fall and \nthey were later discovered by \npolice and found to be suffering \nfrom severe hypothermia and \nfrostbite. Reports say that tem­\nperatures reached minus thirty \ndegrees and as a result of the \nfrost bite the two are facing \namputation of their hands and \nfeet -wh ich will make their next \nelopement that little bit more \ndifficult. \nDOG to be Hung \nIn Tanzania a dog has been \ngiven the death penalty as a \nresult of a highly unusual case \nbrought before the courts. \nBefore the court was a dog \nnamed \"Immigration\" and its \nowner. The crime was that of \nscandalising the name of the \ndepartment of Immigration in \nTanzania. The court heard how \nthe 25 year old owner of the \ndog made regular trips to the \nImmigration department in \nTanzania were he criticised \npeople working their and boast­\ned about how he had named \nhis dog after them. The man \nw~o ha? _a long standing gripe \nwith officials in the East African \ns~ate was found guilty and \ngiven a suspended sentence \nbut his dog was given a far \nworse fate -the death penalty.",

On his playlist for this show Fanning ex plains that due lo a short­\nage of music videos in the RTE music library his choices are limited \n\"Theres an awful lot of videos that we don't hav e, the RTE video library is \nnot as strong as it probably should be. I m ea n to be blunt because it's the \nnational station every video should be there. but the Irish record compa­\nnies, it has to come through them but they are mor e or less the subsideries \nof British record companies so they 're the little brothers, I me an if \nEngland sneezes we catch a co ld. So we ha ve to take what we get so there's \na few programmmes feeding off it including N o Disco, The Den and to be \nblunt videos get lost. .. \nWid ely regarded as the Mu sic Guru of Ireland Fanning is probably the \nmo st frequently quoted person on press releases from up and coming \nband s. So who doe s he think is good and who is his favourite band . DROP \nput it to him that they heard that\" My Bloody Valentine\"was his favourite \nband , ''My Bloody Valentine are not my favourite band at all, I saw them \nlive and I would hone stly say they were the wor st band I've seen live in my \nlife but they released ''Isn't anything'' in about '88 and then they released \n\"Loveless\" in '91 and \"Loveless\" would be in my top ten albums of all time, \nI ab solutely love \"Loveless\" - but they certainly wouldn't be my favourite \nband or anything like that at all A s I say when I saw them live once they \nhad this one thing that they did, it wa s a nine minute sonic noise thing and \nit doe sn 't serve any purpo se other than to seriously iritate and you might \nsay \"but oh that's a statement that's performance art·• it' s not ! i 1 • s b o II ox ! \nit's nonsense! I thought they were rubbish live.'' \nSo what about other band s what will become of former Stone Ro ses front \nman Ian Brown ... \n\"Ian Brown is not as much a mu sician -he's the one who might suffer \nmo st. .. I know the first Stone Ro ses album the songs were Squire/Brown but \nI don 't know how much Brown put in, but Squire w as the music obviously \nso he's able to do stuff and maybe the Seahorses stuff is a bit wimpy an d \nwatery but there's still good songs there - I can well understand fans of \nStone Roses hating Seahorses I kinda like the Seahorses. I find the lead \nsinger a bit wishy washy but well lets see what happen s maybe he ' II get a \nyou might say \"but oh that's a stateme,it that's \nperformance art\" it's ,iot! it's ho/lox! \nbit of edge to him .. ehm what was the question again ... - Oh yeah his album \nhe felt he had to do something he was Ian Brown and he had to do some­\nthing he had a ten point start on anyon e else making a first solo album , in \nother words people were going to listen to it. .. he is not nessesarily a major \nmusician and even when he was singng with stone Roses he wasn't even a \ngreat singer\" \nSo finally we asked Dave the question on everybody's lips; who's going to \nbe big in 98 .... \n\"People keep asking me that.. I just don't know - everytime I recommend a \nband they break up by Christmas and they're back in the dole queues . I'm \nlooking forward to the \"lmbrace\" album just to see if they can deliver but I \ncould change my mind next week .

Say for example , if you have a religious crises and you were as thick as a goldfish w hich has \na two second m emory span. O ne second you w orrying \"Oh shit is there a Go d, is there a M e, H ow do we know if any thing \nis real ?\", and two seconds later you 're thinking \"Oh look, there's a nice lookin g castle over there\" \nOn e day Weird A l Yankovich will do a version of Goldfish exactly the same way as we play it and claim it's a p1sstake!! \nThe band explain to 111e tlw t Miclrnel is in Rock '11 ' Roll band for tire m oney, Dn rrng/r is i11 it for tire wo 111e11 and Sn ,11 j11 st does ,t for t/1e \nmu sic.

I asked G umb to give \nme n11 insight into their so11g-u1riting secrets. • \nSam A lot of bands write songs by jamming , one player saying ,Listen to this, this is cool and the lyricist has then write \nover this. I don't think that is a great way to write a song, it's better to w rite a song as one unit than just by wo rking wi th \na collection of riffs. \nM ichael M usicwise we are not very like-minded, we don't all like the same music. Th ere is a general acceptance, though, \nand that adds a difference to each individual arrangem ent. It's all about contrast! \nA s we ll as that we haven't gone through phases of, ' for a: couple of m onths our songs are going to sound like this', and \nthen change again com pletely. \nGM Influences? \nSam You're influenced as much by the mu sic you don't like as much as the mu sic you like so you know w hat you do n't \nwant to sound like as much as what you want to sound like. \nGM T /roug/rts on tire current state of the mu sic? \nMich ael The re is thing at the moment whe re people give out that the music press dictates what mu ic should be like but \nthat is the case on ly because they let it. lf you look at bands such as Th ese Anim al Men & Sm ash you know that ma few \nmont hs time yo u won't rememb er their names. The music , generally, which stands the test of tim e is not the stuff which \nfits into various fashions, it's the mu sic that stands out on it's own. \nIt's a lot easier for a band to make it if they latch onto a current sound . If you want to sound like Blur,, you're not ever going \nto be as big as them, you're just going to cash in on it (t/reir s11ccess) for a while. \nGM Before we finish have yo11 any m essages to send out to tire renders of tire LEG ? \n\"Plug's available\" (Darragh) \n\"Send us m oney\", \"Tell everyone to \ngo o ut and kill them ­\nselves\" \n\" Sh ut up Sam \" \n011 n m ore serious note \n!Irey did ask 111e to give \nS/w111ie Fly1111 (T/renlre \nRoyal) n11 /ro11 ournble \nme11tion n11d to t/rn11k \nhim for nil tire support \nn11d /relp Ire /rns given the \nband ova tire past few \n1110 11//rs . 111 fact 111n11y \nyo1111g bn11ds /raven lot to \nt/rn11k S/rn111ie n11d tire \nT/rentre Royal for, /re /rns \ngiven tre111endo11s sup­\nport n,rd encouragem ent \nto yo11 11g bands, giving \n//rem n11 opportunity to \npiny, rehearse n11d record \nin Limericks premier live \nven11e. \nPage Eleven \nr \nLIMERICK EVENTS GU ID E \npopular \nh as \nmajor moue to \nthe funk -side, \nfusing soul, hip­\nhop and all that \njazz.

Som e of these changes are for th~ better, (or ar~ because of \ninjury) but w hat baffles us here in Lim erick, and anyone wi th even the slig~test kn ~wl­\nedge of the gam e is the dropp ing of Shann on's Mick Galway . In his place, m the Insh \n2nd row, is Co rk Co n's G abriel Fu lcher, a definite prospect for the future, no doubt, but \nto suggest that Fulcher has matured mt o a player of Mike Galwa y's stand ard is like \ntelling m e that Dami an Clifford (capt of LEG's Sega soccer team ) is a natural replacement \nfor Eric Can tona!!! \nTh e political sw<1pping and chopping continues .... and quiet obviously, Mick Ga _lway \nhas become yet another victim in the U scrntc/1 m y back a11d I'll scratch yours see.nano that \nis rampa nt m lrish team selection decisions.

The \nScots and the Tnsh are the wo rst prepared teams this season, through no fault of the play­\ners, that mu ch they have in comm on. Th e Scottish team is in a transitional phase, added \nto that, Gavin Hastings is a do ubtful starter, (at time of goi11 g to press), his steadying influ­\nence on the team will be sorely missed. \nSelected for the Irish team this Saturday are : Peter Clohessy (Young M unsters), \nAnthon y Fo ley (Shannon), K eith Woods , Ben Cronin and Philip Dan a~e r a~l fr~m \nGarryowen . M y unbiased opinion on ne,·t Saturday's gam e is that the L 1m enck mfluence \nwill be enough to carry us to victory over the Scottish. \nFriends at Limerick F.C. wish to thank everyone wh o p artook in our \n'Music' Tab le Qui z at the Desmond Arms last week.

      "chunk_text": "The Ireland squad will be soon tal<­\ning a well deserved break from \nrugby and heading home to Ireland \nto recuperate before returning to \nthe full rigours of rugby at the \nbeginning of the new season. It \nmust not be forgotten that some \nplayers have not had along period of rest for quite \nsome time now what with the 96/97 season running \ninto the Lyons tour running into the 97/98 season run­\nning into the South Africa tour. Indeed the tour has \nproved to be a very energetic outing for the team and \na lot of the games have been quite physical which has \nmade the tour a busy number of weeks for our insider \nin the team, Denise Fanagan, physiotherapist for the \nIrish Rugby Team. \nDROP caught up with her in Pretoria where she w as busy getting \nthe team into shape for the final two games of the tour which cul­\nminates on Saturday with the final game against South Africa. \nSpeaking to Denise four days before the game against South Africa \nshe explained \"the morale w ith the team is great obviously we \nwere all delighted with the first half of the game on Saturday (first \ngame against South Africa) even though the second half was disap­\npointing. There was some great play and we have created a lot to \nbuild on\" \nA lot to build on indeed however with the game fast approaching \nnot only do the Irish have a lot to build on bit the Springboks \nthemselves will also have something to build on. They will be look­\ning at the performance against the Irish and how they can minimise \nany danger posed by them. So how do the team feel about the \ngame \"they're all looking forward to it - luckily we don't have too \nmany injuries although its a great pity about Anthony Foley who \nprobably won't be playing for the game but we will give him inten­\nsive treatment..he has a problem w ith his ankle that he aggravated \nin the last game against South Africa .... the team are still looking \nforward to the game .. \" \nOn injuries, the side have had a lot of new additions to an original \nline up that already had a few new players - how are the players \ncoming together as a team considering the changes in the team \nsince the beginning of the tour \"there's a fantastic team spirit -\neverybody is getting on really well!\" \nThe Clohessy are having a proper family outing according to \nDenise, with the two brothers playing and \"there Dad is also here \nwith a crowd of Young Munster supporters who have been going \nto all our games for the last two weeks of the tour - they're \ngreat!!\" \nBEHIND THE SCENES OF \nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN \nTOUR \nOn the Social side of things they are now in a the beautiful city of \nPretoria and will stay there until Sunday when they fly home. \nAccording to Den ise the team were taken on a \"night safari in a \ngame park we re we w atched Lions and baboons roam around a \nfew feet aw ay from the safari bus - it was fantastic we all really \nenjoyed it\" \nAt time of writing the team are facing a formidable but by no \nmeans impossible task against the mighty Springboks but before \nthe game has even started the feeling from the camp is that the \ntour w as an extremely worthwhile venture. The team gained a \ngreat deal of experience that will prepare them for the next sea­\nson as a truly International side. @ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the Irish rugby team in \nSouth Africa \ndrop20 \n( \n(",

          "text": "In the last few weeks the Irish Pop \nscene has received a massive injection • \nof adrenaline with the introduction of \ntwo new pop sensations, B•Wikhed \nand Kerri-Ann. The publicity in \nIreland surrounding the launch of \nKerri-Ann's single was massive and \nwith her single riding high in the \ncharts, she embarked on a publicity \ntour around the country. \nShe was signed as a sixteen year old \nbucked tooth schoolgirl w ith a stage school \nbackground. Now with her first single she's a babe pop sensation and des­\ntined for stardom. \nKerri Ann , like Diano Ross in the 60s, was still in school while waiting to \nrecord her first record. This talented Pop-ette will release on album in the new \nfew months. Her current single 'Do you love me Boy?' rocketed to No . 2 in \nthe Irish Charts. This Pop Song is expected to have a similar position in the \nBritish charts when it is released in the UK on the 6th of July. When the new \n'Diana Ross' of Pop Music touched down in Limerick Drop Magazine were \nthere to corner her .... \nUnlike most artists in the public eye Kerri-Ann did not hove to experience the \nhard slog to make it and hod got to a position most artists dream off before \neven launching her career i.e. been signed by a record label. Does she \nthink that its easier for someone to go to an audition and get a record deal \nrather than being in a rock band and getting one that way? \n\"I can't really soy. I wasn't struggling like most bonds. I got lucky. It was \nalways my dream as a little girl to be a pop star. It was hard to get that audi­\ntion, as there were 200 other girls there as well.\" \nSo on the music front how does she describe her music? \n\"100% pure pop.\" \nDo you have much of an input into what you sing, is it all just handed \ndown to you to sing or what way is the song writing approached? \n\"I contribute to the lyrics myself. I hove co-written a b-side\" \nWhat do you think of the Music Industry now that you are a part of it? \n\"My eyes ore definitely more open ... I must be mod ... l've never found pres­\nsure ... there is never any pressure in the way that I hove to do things ... Pop \nmusic is about being young and having a laugh ... that's what I am doing.\" \nWith the by now almost inevitable split in girl and boy bonds perhaps Kerri­\nAnn has over come one huge \nobstacle by going solo in that , •• ,. . , , \na split is impossible unless j~:~,, .:·: \nshe has a split personality. • \nWith the likes of Kylie \nMinogue starting off as a \npop sensation and ending up \non the more indie side of \nthings where does Kerri-Ann \nsee herself in 5 years time? \n\"Ah! That depends. It is out \nof my hands really. I want to \nrecord albums and to be suc­\ncessful.\". Certainly with the \npublicity she is stirring and \nher song on every stations \nplaylist Kerri-Ann may well \n- --,, \n-·· -i. \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n__ --l 17 \n• 18 \n=i 19 \nI 20 -· --1 \n- --'· \nl \n2 \n4 \n3 \n7 \n5 \n6 \n2 \n3 \n6 \n5 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n11 \n15 \n13 \n10 \n9 \n1/w \n1 \n3 \n2 \n12 \nbe doing just that.@ + \n'l'.t-:'.\"ir'.\"':\".-tr=_ --:r:t :-:r·: =-i-- ,_::-::;. ,!'.=. +=. ~=1-i-=...,tr-:-t:j:'\"\"'.i:t :--:rt::::r-T,'.\"'T-:::J=!'.:::+=~\"T-!:::;:::-r •• , -t ~T-~ l= \nC'est La Vie B•Witched \nDo You Love Me Boy KerriAnn \nSex on the Beach T-Spoon \nFeel It Tamperer \nCarnival De Paris Dario g \nGone 'til November Wyclef Jean \nThis Is '98 Asian \nTruly Madly Deely Savage Garden \nUnder the Bridge/Lady Marmalade All Saints \nGot the Feelin' 5ive \n3 LIONS '98 Bad/Skinner & Lightning Seeds \nVINDALOO Fat Les \nGOT THE FEELIN' 5 \nC'EST LA VIE B•witched \nCARNAVAL DE PARIS Dario G \nTHE ROCKAFELLER SKANK Fatboy Slim \nHORNY Mousse TVs Hot'n'Juicy \nLIFE Des'ree \nTHE BOY IS MINE Brandy & Mon ica \nDANCE THE NIGHT AWAY The Mavericks \nFEEL IT The Tamperer featuring Maya \nMY ALL Mariah Carey \nSTRANDED Lutricia McNeal \nKUNG FU FIGHTING Bus Stop &Carl Douglas \nHOW DO I LIVE LeAnn Rimes \nDON'T COME HOME TOO SOON \nDel Amitri \nLAST THING ON MY MIND Steps \nUNDER THE BRIDGE/LADY MARMALADE \nAll Saints \nON TOP OF THE WORLD England United \nTOO MUCH , TOO LlffiE, TOO LATE \nSilver Sun \nntle Artist \nSPEND THE NIGHT Danny J Lewis \nTHE ROCKAFELLER SKANK Fatboy Slim \nCARNAVAL DE PARIS Dario GEternal \nWIZARDS OF THE SONIC Westbam Vs Red Jerry -\nHORNY Mousse TVs hot'n'Juicy -\nI PUT A SPELL ON YOU Sonique \nSOUL IN MOTION DJ Krustfull Cycle \nl'VE BEEN WAITING Maydie Myles \nBAMBAATA Shy FXEbony \nLO DOWN FacsTrouble On Vinyl",

He's been messing \naround on turntables since the \nage of 12 and entered the DMC \nmixing championships in the \nyear that DMC decreed that \ncontestants should go back lo \nbasics, i.e. prove that they could \nget two records in lime rather \nthan the show man type stuff. \nCut duly ignored that and wen t \noff like a bastard, sending the \ncrowd w ild but only coming \nthird in the competition, the per- • \nson who won, was friends of the , f-\njudges. Anyway DMC's loss i : \nturned into Skint's gain as Cut \nLa Roe's two 'Mad Skills' EP \nhave shown just how far you .. __ . •t:/'- . \ncan go with breakbeats.

So on the other end of t!,e \nline is the man himself. • \nSo what's Cut La Roe been up to? \n\"Well I've just got back from Germany and Japan touring w ith Bentley \nRhythm Ace, which was great fun as the Bentley lads are just mad and \ntouring around the wo rld isn't a bod occupation and while it Iasis I'll \nmake the most of it. I've been finishing off my de9ut cilbum, which has \nrun into a few problems over sampling. I sampled this jazz track by \nBob Jomes who is on Columbia records which .is own ecl in turn by \nSony , who also own Skinl, so I thought there would be no problems, \nbut Mr. James had different ideas. So I'.ve had change one·or two • \nthings on th·e album. The single should be ou't in the next few weeks \nand the album will follow a few weeks after.\" • \nThe Big Beal Boutique has been the populadr.ont club for the Skint : \nlabel, overs.!he last two years and now due to· its popularity has !rioved· \nto a larger .venue;has this proved that the_ • \n,,..,;--,-,-------, big beat is not ju~t-a fad? \n\"Ya its always been tossed around Q S the \n. poor man dan~e-music, qui we've proved. \nthrough a lot of hard work that its a 1qt more \nthan just a fad.

          "text": "SOCCER ROCKER \nNiall Quinn continues his fortnightly insight to \nthe World of Soccer and focuses on the \"Gazza \nLegend\" and why he should not be in the \nEngland Squad for the World Cup. \nA question has been asked of most of us in just in just about every \nfootball oriented conversation we've partaken in, whilst in Barstool \nmanager mode, in recent times. The question is of course ... should \nHoddle have brought Gazza lo France? \nSo bored did I become with this question and incessant variants \nupon it, that I answered it with another question ... namely \"Why the \nhell are you asking why an overweight, unfit, thirty one year old \nlard ass who's played three games for ahem star studded \nMiddlesborough since been transferred from an ailing Glasgow \nRangers side he couldn't get into, over whom serious question \nmarks hang in regard to his competence, ability and crucially his \ncommitment .... should be included in any country's World Cup \nsquad?!!\" It's not enough anymore lo reply \"because he's Gazza\", \nhe's just not good enough anymore and the nonsense that's been \nspouted about half a good game from Gazza being enough or \nhow he only needs 20 minutes on the pitch to turn the game . \nAnyone who saw the league cup final will tell you -if they're being \nhonest-that not only can he not turn a game he can't turn dirt with \na shovel!! \nBy now England will have played at least two of their three group \ngames. They may already have their place in the second round \nbooked or if I'm right they could be facing their last group game \n(against Colombia) desperately needing at the very least a result lo \ndrag them through. If the latter is the case don't you just know that \nthe tits'n'oss rags that poss for English press will be crying out that \nnone of this bod karma would've befallen England hod Gazzo \nbeen along. Bullshit!! One expects such mob sentimentality from \nthe tabloids .. .they screamed blue bloody murder when Graham \nTaylor substituted Gory Lineker thus bringing the curtain down on \nhis career bock in Euro 92 and proceeded to harass the poor man \n(Taylor) to the brink of suicide for lhe next two and half years. \ndrop18 \nLike wise their media sibling \"Sky\" who orchestrated a vicious hate \ncampaign against the man and had the cheek to report, with dis­\ngust, the intimidation of Taylor's kids, the late ~ig~t pho~e calls, \nbroken windscreens and the slight matter of his wife being con­\nfronted in O supermarket by a \"fan\" who proceeded to spit in her \nface before giving her a good thumping. All condemned by Sky \nwho of course had done nothing to spur morons on with the likes \nof \"Is Graham Taylor a turnip? -coll now on 0898 Blah Blah \nblah ... calls cost 58p off peak ... \" no I'm not forgetting here either \nthat Taylor was an indecisive and dithering manager and that all \nthe promise he showed at the helm of Aston Villa failed to materi­\nalise when he took over the England job. Then again he didn't let \nRubert Murdoch and his minions pick his team when he was with \nVilla. In any case it was the 11 players in the England shirts that \nthrew away qualification for USA'94 when they lost a two nil lead \nagainst the Dutch at Wembley . Taylor could only stand by and \nwatch. \nAnyhow I've digressed from the core issue here, namely the tabloid \nspurred indignation at the omission of Gazzo. They've heralded \nthe disgust of celebrity after celebrity from Chris Evans to Posh \nSpice with only a few like Tommy Doherty being allowed to point \nout that dropping Gazza was the right thing to do and anyway \nisn't Doherty a Scot so what the hell does he know? \nI was saddened to see Baddie! and Skinner joining the dissenting \nchorus. These are two guys who's opinions I respect and listen out \nfor and there they are on TFI Friday going on about Gazza's goal \nagainst Scotland in Euro 96 being the definitive moment in \nEngland's resurgence .... hell maybe it was but that was in 1996. \nGazza 96 and Gazza 98 ore not comparable by any standard \nand Scotland were probably easier meat than Columbia will be \ntoo. Ultimately the benefactor of all this will be the Gazza legend \nmany English fans may dream of what may have been when the \nWorld Cup is over if only Gazza had been there to save the day. \nSuch an illusion (delusion) would not hove been served by ole Pork \nPelly himself being out there, being found out and proving to him-\nself and to the world once and for all that his star hos waned.@ \n-----------------------",

That's second place, as opposed to the ninth or tenth \nwe've become accustomed to. Even team insiders found it all a bit \nunbelievable. They'd gone to Canada desperately hoping to get \neither of their cars back into the top I 0, but to see Ralf secure a \ncomfortable fifth on the grid and to then have Hill heading for the \npodium(!) ... well ... let's just say it stretched a long way beyond their \nwildest and wettest dreams.And even if it did end with Ralph mak­\ning his not unusual first lap exit (twice) and Damon going out on \nlap 41 with faulty electronics, there can be no doubting the obvious \nupturn in Jordan's competitive form -something that has been sore­\nly lacking all season long. \nEddie Irvine would have us believe it a simple case of the circuit \nbringing out the best in his ex-teams otherwise crappier than a pile \nof day old dog poo 1998 race car. He suggested that Jordan's good \ntraction, adequate engine and strong brakes were ideal (ish) for a \ntrack where overall aerodynamic efficiency is not a priority. \nConsidering that Jordan's technical supervisor Gary Anderson has \nopted to camp out in the team's new wind tunnel until the 198's \n'Car Through Air' problems have been improved upon - if not \nentirely solved -then perhaps our Eddie is right. Maybe team Jordan \nwill head to Magny-Cours (France) and end up outside the top ten \nagain, battling for grid positions w ith perennial no hopers like \nMinardi and Tyrrell. Even if things do go awry, Canada has at least \nraised pulses inside what has been for some time an extremely \ndown-beat team.And if Gary can effect a cure for their mal-practis­\ning aerodynamics (a general lack of downforce and too much drag) \nthen perhaps we might just see Jordan lashing it out in a strong way \ncome the last few races. \nIt wasn't that many Summers back ( 1993 to be exact) that \nJordan faced a similar dilemma. Their 193 race car -the I denotes \nFormula One and 93 the number of second cousin's who ring Eddie \nJordan every weekend in the hope of getting pit passes for the next \nGrand Prix ... or something like that - while it had a reliable and \nmildly potent engine supplied by engine guru Brian Hart the damn \nthing just wouldn't go fast enough and the team looked as if they \nweren't going to score any World Championship points (essential in \nsecuring travelling expenses from the F.I.A for the following year).AII \nseason long they kept tweaking this area and that area, but nothing \nseemed to help the poor 193 and it remained a rather horrid \nmachine.Anderson, who penned the beast, remained convinced that \nthe car had heaps of potential and that all they needed was to figure \nout what aspect of the design needed adjustment, adaptation or \nsimple plain tinkling to unlock it. Then one day, as in an oil streaked \nfairy-tale, their experienced test driver Andre de Cesaris suggested \nthe wheel base be extended and whammo, suddenly the 193 started \nbehaving itself and putting in decent lap times. Of course back then \ndecent lap times for a Jordan were never going to put the fear of \nGod into the likes of Williams, Mclaren, Bennetton or Ferrari, but it \ndid allow Rubens Barrichello and Eddie Irvine to score points at the \npenultimate G.P. in Japan, saving the team millions in freight and \nsilencing all the doubters. \nNow of course the problem that Jordan has is one that can \nbe cured only through adventures in clever engineering and I for \none don't possess the qualifications to help out but even I, a mere \nmotoring Hack, must recognise that 1998 is not the complete dis­\naster which some would have us believe, and that as an engineering \nfirm Jordan are in a much stronger position than at any other time \nin their history. Eddie Jordan has bought in some very fine equip­\nment for his engineers to play with and the drawing office has \nmore bright spark diagram pushers than at any other time. These \nlast two facts should ensure that somewhere down the line they'll \nreturn to the sort of form we witnessed last season - if not better. \nThe thing is though that even after the Jordan's make it back to the \nvery front of the grid young Ralf'I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE \nREST OFYOU BUT I RATHER FANCY AN EARLY SHOWER' \nSch'-!macher will still be around to provide plenty of incredible \nsound bites, dodgy starts and ugly racing incidents.

          "text": "The Ireland squad will be soon tal<­\ning a well deserved break from \nrugby and heading home to Ireland \nto recuperate before returning to \nthe full rigours of rugby at the \nbeginning of the new season. It \nmust not be forgotten that some \nplayers have not had along period of rest for quite \nsome time now what with the 96/97 season running \ninto the Lyons tour running into the 97/98 season run­\nning into the South Africa tour. Indeed the tour has \nproved to be a very energetic outing for the team and \na lot of the games have been quite physical which has \nmade the tour a busy number of weeks for our insider \nin the team, Denise Fanagan, physiotherapist for the \nIrish Rugby Team. \nDROP caught up with her in Pretoria where she w as busy getting \nthe team into shape for the final two games of the tour which cul­\nminates on Saturday with the final game against South Africa. \nSpeaking to Denise four days before the game against South Africa \nshe explained \"the morale w ith the team is great obviously we \nwere all delighted with the first half of the game on Saturday (first \ngame against South Africa) even though the second half was disap­\npointing. There was some great play and we have created a lot to \nbuild on\" \nA lot to build on indeed however with the game fast approaching \nnot only do the Irish have a lot to build on bit the Springboks \nthemselves will also have something to build on. They will be look­\ning at the performance against the Irish and how they can minimise \nany danger posed by them. So how do the team feel about the \ngame \"they're all looking forward to it - luckily we don't have too \nmany injuries although its a great pity about Anthony Foley who \nprobably won't be playing for the game but we will give him inten­\nsive treatment..he has a problem w ith his ankle that he aggravated \nin the last game against South Africa .... the team are still looking \nforward to the game .. \" \nOn injuries, the side have had a lot of new additions to an original \nline up that already had a few new players - how are the players \ncoming together as a team considering the changes in the team \nsince the beginning of the tour \"there's a fantastic team spirit -\neverybody is getting on really well!\" \nThe Clohessy are having a proper family outing according to \nDenise, with the two brothers playing and \"there Dad is also here \nwith a crowd of Young Munster supporters who have been going \nto all our games for the last two weeks of the tour - they're \ngreat!!\" \nBEHIND THE SCENES OF \nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN \nTOUR \nOn the Social side of things they are now in a the beautiful city of \nPretoria and will stay there until Sunday when they fly home. \nAccording to Den ise the team were taken on a \"night safari in a \ngame park we re we w atched Lions and baboons roam around a \nfew feet aw ay from the safari bus - it was fantastic we all really \nenjoyed it\" \nAt time of writing the team are facing a formidable but by no \nmeans impossible task against the mighty Springboks but before \nthe game has even started the feeling from the camp is that the \ntour w as an extremely worthwhile venture.

          "text": "'Whats to say' is the title track of a four-track demo from five \npiece 'The Cult', and whats to say about these guys is that they've \ngot a pretty addictive sound that takes just a bit if getting used to. \nThe opening track is a grower. On first listen it does sound a \nlittle off beat and mistimed, but it sounds more impressive on every \nlisten and vocalist Eoin Rothery has one of those instantly recog­\nnisable voices. The underlying guitar rhythm sticks in the memory \nand makes up for the lack of lyrical depth. \nThe other tracks are different to say the least. 'Yeats was a \npunk' is an o.k. attempt at punk rock, sounding a little like The \nUndertones in places. 'P.T.O.' is rather in the same vain as 'Whats \nto say\" while the final track 'The Future' is perhaps the best track \nwith Rothery's vocal range been tested to the full. However the \nlyrics are a bit dodgy, and 'The Cult' would do well to stay clear of \nlines like \"I'm so sorry for been so pissed\". \nOverall, 'The Cult' have got something going on. This demo \ncould have been a bit more creatively packaged, and the lyrics \ncould be better, but the guitar works great and the rhythms memo ­\nrable, and that can be enough to get some attention. (7/10) \nNEW RELEASES \nTHE CROCKETTS - Flower Girl \nA bit mad is the best way to describe the third single by \nWelsh band 'The Crocketts'. Never has a song sounded like so \nmany other records and managed to maintain a formula that gives \na start and an ending. \nFronted by Dublin born Davey Crockett (the other band \nmembers are Richard Turpin ,Dan Boone and Owen Cash), they \ntake their influences from all over the shop, and traces of the \nGypsy Kings, Kurt Cobain and Van Morrison and most notably \nPavement are clear on 'Flower Girl'. Its chorus would not sound \nout of place on Barney, and listening to the song you just don't \nknow where its going to go next. \nIn an age when bands are slated for relying too heavily on \ntheir influences, The Crocketts almost pull the piss by using all their \ninfluences in just one track. \nThe b-sides are impressive, the pick of them being \"Mrs \nDonnelly'', which is a lot more radio freindly than the single itself \nand is very like Wisconsins finest \"'he Violent Femmes\" . \nHaving won a single of the week in Melody Maker last year, \nThe Crocketts have been getting attention thanks to their brand of \nobscure rhythms. This is a track that people will love or hate. It will \neither sound like a muddled mess or ingeniusly innovative. (7/10) \n( No Silence in One Minute Silence ) \nIn recent years Ireland has been hailed for if many different \nstyles and taste in music, but as yet we have to hail a band in the \nheavy / speed metal genre as one of our own until now. \n'One Minute Silence' are a London based band but are front­\ned by a Tipp man called Brian Barry, who on his best moments on \ntheir debut album 'Available in all Colours'. could be mistaken for a \nyoung Zac de La Rocha .. \nThe album is an 'onslaught of gargantuan metalloid riffs and \nhypnotic hip-hop rhythms' which is attempting to fill the void left in \nrap metal since Rage against the machine last album 'Evil Empire', \nand is has to be said it does this rather well, with Red Hot Chilli \nPeppers influence also recognisable on tracks such as 'Remain \nCalm' and 'South Central' ( the bands first single which indicates \nBarry's background, \"its along, long, way to Tipperary, South \nCentral Tipperary\"). \nLets get this straight, if you haven't heard of the likes of \ndrop21 \nRATM of Limp Bizkit then don't touch this album with a barge pole. \nBands like 'One Minute Silence' don't intend to impress the majori­\nty, the intend to make a clear impression of their intense angst and \ndisgust, lets us all know we're screewed (the F word is a very pop­\nular word on the album). \nTheir songs all have a meaning, like the opening track 'New \nDogs, Old Tricks' which is clearly about the Northern Ireland \nTroubles, \" Black the scene, the gold, the white, the green, lowered \nthe flag for the dream, but in some eyes for a gleam\",. Its clear in \nBarry's declaratory vocals that they mean what they sing, were not \ntalking about 'you're the air that I breathe, your all that I need' stuff, \nthis is energetic. rebellious mus ic with a clear intent. \nIronically though, I feel most of the fans of this type of music \nmiss the point of it all and just love it because its loud, abrasive, in \nyour face, and pisses people off. \nListen, if this is your music, then make sure you get this \nalbum. 'One Minute Silence' have been making waves in England, \nsupporting bands like Clawfinger' and The Deftones', and it won't \nbe long for their on the cover of KERRANG.

          "text": "DROP Fashion Correspondent Gillian Chawke \ntakes a look at trends emerging and what we \nshould be looking out for in the next few \nmonths. \nWhether one likes to admit it or not, being \"fashionable\" does place \nsome degree of importance in everyone's lives. Whether it takes the \nform glancing in their mirror on the way out of the house or studying \nthe latest issues of Cosmo etc. to find out what to wear , you will all \nhave at one stage in your day had one fashion related though. Knee­\nhighs, long skirts, bigger jewellery ... these were just o few of the \n\"looks\" that we saw on the runways and expect to see on the streets of \nlimerick this autumn. So what else should we know about ... \nON THE CATWALK \n• One of the specific looks we \nnoticed \"emerging\" for this season \nwere slacks under long tunics and \nmicro minis. Kenzo the highly \nrespected 60 year old Japanese \ndesigner, was very strong with this \nlook, along with Chinese designer \nAnna Sui {pronounced \"Swee \"}. It \nis all very reminiscent of the late ~ \n60's and early 70's; think \"Age of / i \nV Aquarius\". The fabrics used were 1 \noften transparent and floating, ere- • r · , \ncling the allusion of \"one piece\". \"\"'-'--------\"\"\"-~ \n• Jean Galliano is way into retro and the 40's, but with an underlying \nFar East feel to many of his designs. Keep a look out for this Oriental \ninfluence as we think it might be getting stronger ... i.e. when you run \nacross a fob satin \"happy coat\" in one of those back street vintage \nshops, think twice before you pass it up. \n• A mix of ethnicity is also something to be watching closely. The \ndesigners might be travelling in India and fall in love with a fabric and \na week later they will be in Africa and find something that will blend \nperfectly with the India piece, resulting in a multi-cultural feel to the \nclothes they are creating. \nIN THE HIGH STREET \n1 . Denim {and I mean the original Levi blue) is what you need to tell \nthe world you are on top of the fashion trends. And if you really want \nto be hip, gel a pair of blue denim pedal pushers ... Too cool!! and to \nbe found in most Limerick boutiques. \n2. Get something orange!! It is still here and picking up steam ... lip­\nsticks, nail enamels and accessories galore are available if you don't \nwant to \"wear it\". Alternatively, for those of you who love lavender, \nyou can wrap yourself in it head lo toe and feel sure that you have on \nthe \" in\" colour. It worked lo Renee Cronin's advantage with her \n\"Amethyst Flow\" collection in the LCAD fashion show not so long ago. \n3. Small beaded bags and feathers are what everyone needs for \nevening, and if you love butterflies, this is the season for them. Put one \nin your hair rather than a flower, sew them onto bags, bums and \nbras??. Tres femme!! \n4. Grey seems to be creeping up as \nthe \"new black\" .... you will see it very \nstrong this season in all shades and \nshines. Metallic's, and silver, soft dove \ngrey cottons, all work very well with \nthat little orange lee you just \"had to \nhave\". \n5. The slit skirts that were developing \nas \"hot\" are here and look great, and \nfor the daring devils amongst \nyou .... the lingerie look is readily \navailable for day wear. Although, \nsome might say, the lingerie thing is wearing a little \"thin\" ... no pun \nintended! \n6. If you want to give those stilettos a rest, sneakers are getting lo be \nubiquitous, even at the office. You can find them in every colour and \nstyle, actually the more bizarre the better!! With summer being more \ncasual, you more conservative types might want to give these a try. \nAnother shoe option that will be fun are ballet slippers or Mary Janes \nwith a very rounded toe, for those of you who don't need that extra 6 \ninches. \nWATCH OUT : Next Issue we talk to some of the LSAD Degree students \nat their end of year show. @",

It \nmust not be forgotten that some \nplayers have not had along period of rest for quite \nsome time now what with the 96/97 season running \ninto the Lyons tour running into the 97/98 season run­\nning into the South Africa tour. Indeed the tour has \nproved to be a very energetic outing for the team and \na lot of the games have been quite physical which has \nmade the tour a busy number of weeks for our insider \nin the team, Denise Fanagan, physiotherapist for the \nIrish Rugby Team. \nDROP caught up with her in Pretoria where she w as busy getting \nthe team into shape for the final two games of the tour which cul­\nminates on Saturday with the final game against South Africa. \nSpeaking to Denise four days before the game against South Africa \nshe explained \"the morale w ith the team is great obviously we \nwere all delighted with the first half of the game on Saturday (first \ngame against South Africa) even though the second half was disap­\npointing. There was some great play and we have created a lot to \nbuild on\" \nA lot to build on indeed however with the game fast approaching \nnot only do the Irish have a lot to build on bit the Springboks \nthemselves will also have something to build on. They will be look­\ning at the performance against the Irish and how they can minimise \nany danger posed by them. So how do the team feel about the \ngame \"they're all looking forward to it - luckily we don't have too \nmany injuries although its a great pity about Anthony Foley who \nprobably won't be playing for the game but we will give him inten­\nsive treatment..he has a problem w ith his ankle that he aggravated \nin the last game against South Africa .... the team are still looking \nforward to the game .. \" \nOn injuries, the side have had a lot of new additions to an original \nline up that already had a few new players - how are the players \ncoming together as a team considering the changes in the team \nsince the beginning of the tour \"there's a fantastic team spirit -\neverybody is getting on really well!\" \nThe Clohessy are having a proper family outing according to \nDenise, with the two brothers playing and \"there Dad is also here \nwith a crowd of Young Munster supporters who have been going \nto all our games for the last two weeks of the tour - they're \ngreat!!\" \nBEHIND THE SCENES OF \nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN \nTOUR \nOn the Social side of things they are now in a the beautiful city of \nPretoria and will stay there until Sunday when they fly home. \nAccording to Den ise the team were taken on a \"night safari in a \ngame park we re we w atched Lions and baboons roam around a \nfew feet aw ay from the safari bus - it was fantastic we all really \nenjoyed it\" \nAt time of writing the team are facing a formidable but by no \nmeans impossible task against the mighty Springboks but before \nthe game has even started the feeling from the camp is that the \ntour w as an extremely worthwhile venture. The team gained a \ngreat deal of experience that will prepare them for the next sea­\nson as a truly International side. @ \nThe Brazen Head, 0 Connell St, Limerick \nproud supporters of the Irish rugby team in \nSouth Africa \ndrop20 \n( \n(",

H ard one to predict as both Big \nJack and El Tel are fielding bloody strong team s. You shou ld recognise m ost of \nthe names on the Ireland side - lads like Alan Kernaghan and Eddie \nMcGoldrick who played a big part in our World Cup Qualification and A lan \nMcloughlin , who scored the goal that took us to the finals. As Ireland don 't \nhave a competitive game 'til late March, it's also a goo d chance to get much of \nthe squad together for a work o ut. \nAnd what of our m ost recent competition gam e - the 4 - 0 trouncing of \nNorthern Ireland in Belfast ? I really don't think it's sunk in wi th peop le and \nit probably won't until later.in the qualifying series. Th e enormity of that win \nand its implications .... namel y that the Nor th are out and we've done a lot of \nthe hard work involved in qualifying ·for England '96 already. The No rth were , \nof course, (and there's really no kinder way of putting it) .... utter shite. The \nqualifying series isn't even half way there yet and they've already m ade a time \nhonoured balls of it. Northern Ireland have now lost the two games they could \nleast afford to lose - Portugal and the Republic in Belfast. In all likelihood \ny'see, they'll lose to us again in Dublin and to Portugal in Lisbon. They really \nneeded to take something from the Belfast games and failed mi serably in that \n• regard. Are there any words of consolation I can offer them ?? ........ Tough shit, \nlads! Har Har Dee Har Har Har !1 \nFinally, back on the home front again, Limerick were unlucky to lose 1 -0 away \nt~) UCO on Sunday last. Okay so they lost - but Limerick F.C. kept the score a \nlot more respectable than most others m;maged against the in-form students. \nLimerick F.C. are a team worthy of your support.

When, in \nAugust 1991, the only \nrecently-formed \nProdigy followed a first \nEP (What Evil L11rks), \nwith a second record­\ning called 'Charly', \nthose desperately try­\ning to instil some matu­\nrity within an other­\nwise wild, brash and \nstill young dance scene, \nwere mortified at the \nsong which they could \nonly consider as a \nregression to kitschy \nSuch so-called \nI , , raves are the very \nC llfe \nevents Liam abhors \nand his association \nwith the_ Tokyo bash \nis something he \nwants badly to let \nslide. It reflects \nnothing of the rg;tl \nrave culture, he \nstates emphatically, \nand it is with this \nscene - this wild, \nfree, love-buzzed \nattitude - that he \npop culture. \n\"I think 'Charif, when \nit came out, was an \noriginal record, \" Liam \nmost passionately \n~eeks a connection. \nHowever , it is not \nfalse hippness \nadopted ; for Liam _ \nlike so many others \n~ the-rave scene is \nthe public celebra­\ntion of his ow n \nyouthful energy and \nrebellion. It is a free­\ndom of expression \nbut one which, he says, with a sigh for it's defence. \"There wa s nothing \nlike that out at that particular time. It got abused by \nthe fact that_ it was in the charts and little kids w ere \nbuying it because_it had a funny, cartoon cat in it! That \nwasn't really my aim and I kinda got disheartened. I \nthought, 'I didn't write this record for that, so why is it \nsuddenly turning into a really crap, commercial record \n?' A lot of people ~ who weren't around when the \nrecord actually came out -didn't understand the buzz. \nAll they saw was that it was in the charts, that it \nsounded really kiddish and that loads of kids w ere \nbuying it. But that wasn't what we were about and \nthat's why we've never done anything like it since. In \nfact. after we released our first album, The Prot:ligy \nExperience, in. 1992, we decided .... \" he backtracks, \n\" .... Well, me, myself -I decided - to grow up a bit and \n••it was, like, the biggest \nacknow ledges sadly, is being muzzled by the British \nGov ernm ent's recently imp osed Criminal Justice Bil!. \nH owev er, even while he obviously opposes the Bill \n(which, am ong other things, deems-dancing to a series \nof repetitive beats with 10 or more people at an outside \nvenue, a crimin al offence), Liam finds _discussing it an \nuncomfortable task. Freely admitting that he's 'not \nreally a political kinda person', The Prodigy's recent \nalbum , 'Mu sic for a Jilted Generation', w ith it's inlay \ncover of a raver slashing the ties \n1\nof a rope-bridge \nbetwe·en an outdoor rave event and:a posse of police, \nhas, howe ver, prompted people to look to him as a \nsound system, the biggest \nstage and the biggest load of· \ncrap ever ! \nIt wasn't a rave at all -\nIt was more like a giant \nSmash Hits party !~ \nget into inuch more mature-sounding styles of dance music and when I wrote '011e \nLove' last year, w ·ell, that was kinda like the turning point in The Prodigy mus ic.\" \nIndeed it appeared to be the point at which Liam finally procured a fair slice of self­\nconfidence too, relaxing in his position as Prodigy frontman, proud, at last, of past \nachievements and eager to move the band on. For while the Essex foursome had \nsealed a successful chart ride with tracks' Everybody in the Place', 'Fire' and 'Wind it \nUp', it was from 'One Love' to the most recent album recording, 'Music for a Jilted \nGeneration', that musicmake r_Liam managed to build the band's reputation into \nthat of a serious, credible and yet still highly popular hardcore band. \n\"I really like our sound,\" he says, \"and on .the album ('M11sic for •• .') we've mixed a \nlot of different, interesting instruments, not just using the same keyboard sound s \nthat everybody else uses. Y'know, I was digging deep for sounds people hadn 't \nused in dance music before - Live music like guitars and flutes. The next single we \nrele·ase will be Poison which is a really down-tempo track -It's really slow and we've \nnever reieas~d an}'~hing like that before but I don't care because ••• well ... because I \nlike it. It's different and ffike to~J:5e-different!!-\nThe fluffs of the past still seem to cast shadows though, and he is vehemently \nopposed to being classed on any lines even slightly parallel to commercial chart \ngroups. He speaks with obvious derision about a past Summer gig played at Japan's \nspokesperson. \n\"Over the last couple of years the Government have \nbeen trying to clamp down on the whole party scene -basically just youth culture \nin general -and this w as topped off by the Criminal Justice Bill. But that only came \nabout this year and 'Mus ic for a Jilted Generation' wa s the result of things we had \nfelt for a long time. The Bill being pa·ssed the same year that we brought the album \nout with that picture in the inlay card, was just a total coincidence.\" \nLiam states, \"A lot of people (NM£ , M elody Maker) have asked me to talk about it in \nspeeches and stuff but I always say no. It's very hard for me because I'm not really \na political kinda person and even though I've been feeling very strongly about this, \nit's not really the type of thing I wanna drag myself down with. I'm w ·ith the music. \nThat's my energy - whether it's hip hop, indie, techno, whatever - I'm with the \nmus ic. I'm not with the negative politics.\" \nAnd , indeed, after 4 years of consistently pushing the musical boundaries to con­\nvince others of his seriousness, taking on the musical challenges to convince him­\nself, it's satisfying to see that Liam has now -finally, proudly -found.his niche. \nWhat's left to be said? Nothing. Just rave on, Liam ! \nSiobhan Colgan \n(THE PRODIGY play The Point Depot, Dublin Sat 31 Dec & The Metroland, \n_Waterford,~ Jan 1995 ) \nfirst 'rave', where Liam and lads found themselves on a line-up with ca·pella and_ 2 '. \n• Page 13 \nF ., ') \n~.A ~s,, .. \n.J",

What will a football junkie like my self do during the \nfootball famine that is the greater part of June, July and \nAugu st. The on ly place I can think (_>f that they'll be playing \ngoal-games is inside the Arctic Circle but are you really \ninterested in me singing the praises of underdog s Bodo­\nGI imp Harriers coming f_rom be~ind to beat A._F.~­\nRe yahvic 2-1 in the lceland1c Cup Final replay .... ! d1dn t \nBrought to you by the Man-In­\nThe-Know, Rockin' Hitcher \nHimself, NIALL QUINN ..... \nm ost likely be their only hope of silverware this season \nas Blackburn seem to have a firm if not copperfastened \ngrip on the league title, though Leeds Utd . could do their \nold foe a favour when Btackburn play them on Saturday \nas Leeds are still fighting hard for a UEFA Cup spot. \nThough even if Blackbum lose at Elland Road they may \nbe too far ahead to be caught. 'Till next time. \nthink so. ,. \nNow before the flood ot' letters arrive, suggesting that i \nwrite about tennis, can I just point out that tennis is, in fact, \na shit sport played by Big Girls Blouses and soppy girlies \nwho wear silky scarves like air-hostesses and dnnk half \npints of 'Heino' (probably). The only Wimbledon I'll be \nwriting for is the one Viny Jones plays for. Now piss off!! \nWhat else is on? The Rugby World Cup (Oh Gawd!) .... \nPlenty of GAA (Oh Jaysus, don 't get me started). Anyw~y, \nI'll get on with it: Limerick earned _another couple of wms \nin the last few days -wins that take them closer to a play off \nplace with Finn Harps to decide who goes up to the pre­\nmier division with UCO and Drogheda . \nOn Sunday last they walked all over L~n~ford Town, b:at~ \ning them 3-0 in a thoroughly entertammg game . Da1th1 \nMcMahons goal (limerick's second) was _the pie~ of the \nthree ... Absolutely Brilliant. it was Da1th1 agam who \nscored the onlv goal against Kilkenny City a few days ear­\nlier in what real sports journalists call \"a dour encounter\". \nI spoke with several of theUm:rick players later on m the \nDesmond Arms (who quite kmdly sponsor post-match \nmeals for the teams) and they felt the game was as frustrat­\ning on the pitch as it was on the terrace. Basically, Kilken­\nny fielded eleven goalkeepers who were under stnct \norders not to attempt to play football at any cost. So we \nwere treated to 90 minutes of eleven K ilkenny players \ncrowding their ow n box ,ind goa l-line. I wonder if their \nclub motto is the Latin trnnslation of \"D efend For Yo ur \nLives\". Anyway, Limerick eventually picked up the three \npoints which is what m atters most at this stage. As I was \nsaying, I was chatting with some of the players - dead \nsound blokes they are too, so watch out fur som e of their \npersonal profiles in 'WORD UP ' in the next coup le of \nissues of the L.E.G. Meanwhile, mak e sure that you get to \nHogan Park for Limericks last home gnme ()f the \nseason - that vital gam e with Finn Harp s on Sun-\nday 23 April. \nNorthern Ireland seem to have taken some lessons \nfrom Kilkenny City in the art of annoying the shit \nout of everyone present. Thou gh -credit w here it'~ \ndue -they took their goal excellently. It w.is c1 lst) a \nday when you really need the likes nf John Sheri­\ndan to be on form and he, c1nd others with him , hc1d \na quiet day. A 1-1 draw wc1sn't an absolute disaster \nbut it was a bigger set-back than Jack Charlton was \nadmitting. It has basically given Portugal the initic1-\nhve : We've slipped up and they know thnt if they \ndon't slip they'll top the group . On the up side \nthough; it has set up the game on Wednesday 26 \nApril in Dublin to be n hotly contested one.

The pub , while dating back \nto the early part of the last century (when it was known as \nthe quaint 'Captain Hog's and before that, 'Arthurs'), is, in \nfact, one of the oldest registered pubs in Limerick City. It's \na history that the new management , Orbit Taverns \nLtd., are eager to preserve. Reopening the pub on 31 \nMarch , Joan Syed of Orb it Taverns and Bar Manager , \nFiona Kiely, have worked hard to maintain the pub's \natmosphere, with help from bar-person, Ronan \nO'Brien, and much support from Joan's husband, \nWasiif. Monday nights sees local songster, Siobhan \nO'Brien, playing a beautiful acoustic blend of folk and \nrock to the packed pub while the near future promises \nmore musical treats when the University of Limer­\nick Trad' Society kick-start their regular spot. Music \nobviously plays a big part of the pub 's already .icclaimed \nreputation, but those who may just prefer a quier pint with \nfriends can still enjoy the surroundings during an afternoon \nll!nchb~~a_k, wit_h delicious homemade soups anc sandwich­\nes on-the menu.

MAY 6, 1905. \nThe_ N a_tion.~i Assurance collapse is a dreadful \ncalamity; it will probably bring · ruin to the doors of \nmany of the unfortunate shareholders who have now \nnot only lost all their invested money but who \n~vill be called upon to pay up an amount not yet known \nto m~et the expenses of_ winding up this disastrous en­\nterpns_e. And such nice, respectable names figured on \nthe. d~rectorate ! 80 many of them real, genuine \nUmomsts, too! Aud one of them Frederick C Pilk­\nington, D.L., J.P., is a director ol the Great So~thern \nand w·estern Railway, in which so many widows, \norphans? and struggling people have their money, and \nover which a real baronet presides. It is certainly pru­\ndent that the shareholders of the G. S. & W. Co. should \nlook around them and before them. \nIn view of the terrible fate of the National Assurance· \nCo., the shareholders of the G. S. and W. Railway \nought to be thankful to those ene1·getic gentlemen who \nhave moved in the matter of that Railway. The direc­\nt~rs of the G. S. and W. ·Railway are all men bearing \nhighly-respectable names, just as do the directors of the \nNational Assurance Co .; indeed, one of the directors \nof the ill-fated and utterly mis-managed National As­\nsurance Co. is also on the Board· of the G. S. and V·l. \nRailway of depreciated profits. It is· well to take these \nthin&s in time, and whilst thei:e is something to save \nand improve ; the shareholders of the National As­\nsurance Co. have nothing to do now but in addition to \nbearing the complete loss of their invested capital, pay \nup whatever additional call that may be made upon \nthem. The shareholders of the G. S. and W. Railway \nhave a valuable asset, though a considerably depreciated \none to look after; and if they are sensible they will \nlook after it. -\nThe Chairman and Directors of the G . S. and W . \nRailway have been served with the following notice:­\n\" TAKE NOTICE that we, the undersigned twenty or \nmore, Stockholders in the Great Southern and Western \nRailway Company of Ireland, holding in the aggregate \nstoc~ to tne amount of fifty thousand pounds, do hereby \nrequire y.ou, the Chairman and Directors, of the said \nC~mpany to call an Extraordinary General Meeting of \nsaid Company for the-purposes and objects following, \n.that is to say:-\nIn a circular sent out to Shareholders signed by the \nHon. Secretaries of the Committee, Mr. M. Sullivan, \nLL.B., and Mr. Donohoe, J.P., the following grave \nstatement--a statement that in view of the colfapse of \nthe National Assurance Co., should be carefully con­\nsidered by every shareholder in the Company-is set \nout : -\" In 1897 and previous years the Great Southern \nand Western Railway paid 5 and 5½ per cent'. Dw·ing \n1898, 1899, and 1900 it paid 5 per cent. In 190\n1\n1 the \ndividend. fell to 3 per cent, and it has never since reached_ \n4 per cent. In 1904 tho dividend for the June half-yea!' \nwas 3}, and for the Decei:nber half-year 3il-that is, 3~ \nfor the whole year. \nThe falling off from even 5 per cent. to 3~ per cent. \nmeans a falling off of £1 7s. Gel. in the yearly income \nfrom each £100· of Stock. As the total amount of \n\" Ordinary Stock.,, is over 5 millions (£5,325,520), the \nreduction of the Ordinary Shareholders' yearly income \namounts to the large sum of £73,225. \nWill the dividends go lower? Will the Great Sou them \nfollow those Irish Railways which pay 3 per cent. or \nless If so, how will Preference Shares, Debentures, \nand the borrowing pqwer of our Company be affected ? \nOr , would it not be possible ·so to manage that the \n' good old times ' of 5 and 5½ per cent. might come \nback ? The Great Northern pays 6½ and 6if. \nLook at the matter in another way. So recently as \n1898 Great Southern Shares were 147½. The market \nvalue is now (Ma rch, 1905) 92¼-a fall of over 55. Th e_ \nmarket value at present is under 5 millions-a falling \noff in value of nearly 3 millions of pounds. No doubt \nsome of this reduction in value should be set down to the \ngeneral depreciation caused by the expenditure on the \nBoer War, but even allowing 20, for this general de­\np~·eciation, how are the remaining 35 points of reduc­\ntion to· be accounted for? It is not sufficient to say \nthat the ' Amalgamation ' caused this fall · in Stocli:­\nvalue? In June, 1900', the Directors 'congratulated'. \nthe Shareholders on the passing of· the Amalgamation \nAc~s, but although the Amalgamation has proved a \nfruitful source of loss, no one has yet shown that it \naccounts for the whole depreciation in the vaiue of \n' Ordinary Stock.' \" \n1.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

If the \nDe~artm~nt employed a~1 e~pert, surely it was some­\none_ a busmess _to see he did his duty and attended to his \n~usmes~. ~~is, h?wever, is one of the weakest points \nm the admmistration of the Agricultural Boa rd. They \nseem _ to have no system of in~pection in the Depart­\nmen~at lea:;it, no competent mspection-to see that \nthe lect~r~rs and technical instructors are kept to theil' \nwork faithfully and according to their agreements. The \nle?turers and experts seem to be left to their own sweet \nwill. _While, of c~urs~, a~ expert or a specialist is not \nt? be mterfered with m his routine work , at the sam e \n. time some sort of supervision should be in force to see \n.t~_at du~ks and dra~es were . not made of an important \nt~ 1al. w hi?h at ~~e. time Pa,rhamen t was being moved to \ngive special facilities to, and which the Ohancellor of the \nExchequor, badgered and cornered by the Irish M em­\nbers, and some of the leading people in the tobacco \ntrade, at la.st . consented to give what practically \na~nounted to a big bounty to encourage the experiment. \n~t would al:'pear the experiment in that year was re­\nstricted _to a little over an acre, the place selected being \na plot m th~ ground of the Munst er Institute a few \nm~les outside Cork. The soil was admirable'. The \nIrish: plants were strong and healthy ones-better than \nthe imported French ones. The ground was heavily \n~anured, and the c~op gave an early promise of being a \nbig success. But it turned out an absolute failure. \nWhy was it not a success 1 Was it properly attended \nto?· Tobacco-growing requires almost the attention of \na _flower-gai·den. Was the crop even weeded 1 In short, \ndid ~he expert who had o_nly this small plot really attend \nto his duties 1 The Agncultu_ral Depa rtment t~ll us in \ntheir report for that year:- \" Much damage was done to \nthe crop by rooks.\" Sw-ely such an a·ccident could \nhave been prevented. Here was a crop raised artifi­\ncially: Some of the plants actually imported \nat great expense from France. Yet a small boy \nwith a pair of clappers, or an old man with a flint-lock \nmusket could not be employed at a shilling a day to pro­\ntect .such a valuable crop from the crows. Did it come \nto the knowledge of the Department that matters at the \nl\\funstet Institute farm-and we believe it did-were \nbe1ng sadly neglected? Surely this was a case of losing \n. the sheep for a pennyworth of tar. \n· Further, when the leaf-crop was gathered in, or as \nmqch of it as the French .expert chose to collect, no \neffort seems to have been made to give the crop a fair \nchance of being cured. AJ,, the Agricultural Depart­\nment report says:-\" In drying the crop_~n !),ttempt was \nmade to dispense with a costly house and heating appa­\nratus. A rough, wooden shed· was therefore er~cted -in \nthe field, and there the leaves were dried, ·and then they' \nwere removed to a barn in which a coke stove supplied \nthe necessary heat .. \" After such a rude attempt at cur-· \ning the plants much could not be expected. We might \nask, was the expert restricted in his attempts to cure the \nplants 'by having imperfect tools? 0i· did anyone see \nwh _at he was attempting·to do ? Or, and we ask the ques­\ntion. again, w.as the Department informed or aware of \n_ the negl!icted state of affairs? -.But let us quote the De-\n., pai;tment's repoi,t itself:-\" A special expert is required \n.to superintend the fermentation of tobacco, ancl, in­\nstead _of procuring an officer from abroad for this pur­\npose, the leaves were sent to Paris with the object of \nhaving them fermented in the Government factory \n• there. tr nfortunaiely considerable difficulty arose in \nhaving the tobacco transferred from the Custom House \non its arrival in France. Delays occuri-ed, and when \nthe. tobacco eventually arrived at the Government fac-• \ntory, it bad greatly deteriorated owing to the absorption \nof moisture.\" The fact really was, no attempt had been \nmade by the Department to obtain the free entry of the \nleaf with the French Custom House people, and the \nleaves lay exposed and sodden at Dieppe for some t]il-ee \nweeks bcfoi·e the necessary per~it was obtained. \n• \"BUY NAVAN BACON AND HA.MS. BEST ON \nTHE MARKET.\" \n\" Ask for it and see that you get it.\" \n\"Bold by a.II leading Purveyon.\" \nThe Agricultural Department's report ends here.- But \nthere is a sequel. They do not tell us what was the end \nof ~his costly experiment, the result of a four years' \ntri~l, and the product .of a highly-paid expert speci~lly \nbrought over from Paris. The tobacco leaves, we be­\nlieve, when they reached the Paris Government factory, \nwere in such a rotten condition owing to the delays in \ntransit, and the wretched way in which they were \npacked, that they had to be thro.wn out on the manure \nheap and burned. Such was the ending of this costly \nexperiment. Incompetence, neglect, and carelessness \nall round . \nNow, we do not wish to be too hard on the Technical \nDepartment ; but.if this is a sample of the work done by \nit, it is a sorry exhibition of carelessness, neglect, and \nindifference, not to mention wanton waste. of money \nwhich was-and is so-sadly wanted in other ways. -There \nshould be some system of inspection or, overlooking \nwhich would prevent such a fiasco as this. If it,had \nbeen the first or second year of the tobacco -experiment \nit might be condoned, but at the end of the fourth \nyear's trials, taking the most charitable view of the \nm atter, such incompetence and neglect deserve severe \ncensure on those who direct and control--or affect to do \nso-such matters. In my next article I shall deal with \nlast year's experiment and other m atters, which show \nthe Agricultural Department is taking a rather strange \nview of its rights and privileges in connection with \ntobacco culture and curing. \nR.H. 0. \nTHE YERDICT OF THE MANUFACTURI BS. \n'f HIS week we pu~lish a third batch of interesting \nletters from Insh m anufacturers concerning the \nas-good-and-as-cheap policy.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

That 'article which appeared 'in our issue of \nNovember 10th, 1900, was on Boots. We frnd, on \nreferring back to it, that our appr~ximate calculation, \nassuming that all the leather used m the boots had 'to \nbe imported-and as a matter of fact that was not, or is \nnot, so-was that about £800,000• a year would go to \nshoeing the population of Ireland. Our information \nat the time was t4at not one-tenth of that sum was \nkept in the country, or in other words, that £720,000 \nwas lost to it because Ireland did not shoe itself. • Since \nthen a considerable improvement has be~n effected .. \nWinstanley's is the largest boot factory in Ireland, and \nin our Christmas Number, December, 190·3, they an­\nnounced that they employed over 300 workers in their \nfactory, and found that number insufficient to execute \nall orders, and added, \" skilled labour urgently l·e­\nquired.\" The Lee B'oots, of Cork; Hearn and Cahill, \nof \\V'aterford; Williamson's, of Belfast, no doubt also \nconsiderably expanded their output; but in view of our \napproximate calculation four and a half years ago, that \neven assuming that Ireland imported all the leather \nused in the boots made-which she does n-ot, and the \ntanning industry is capable of great development--that \nthe country paid to foreign makers £720>,000 annually \non the head of ·boots, there is a great margin left to be \nworked upon. There is a good deal of picking on \n£720 ,000· a year, and notwithstanding the considerable \nadvance that has been made in the way of the Irish \nconsumers giving up playing the fool by supporting \nforeign boots when Irish boots were to be had as good \nand as cheap, there is still a great deal of work left for \nthe common-sense Irish boot-buyer to do. Every reader \nof the LEADER is a purchaser of boots, anc} we put it to \nthe intellect of each one of them that they should de­\nmand in the shops in .which they deal that they be \nenabled to sample Irish-made boots that are fighting \nin competition with foreign boots. If they find them \nright as regards quality and price, they should most un­\ndoubtedly give them the preference. If our· readers \nfind that the shops in. which they deal do not offer a \nfair opportunity to their customers to-sample and use \ntheir own judgment on the merits of Irish-made boots \nas against British and foreign boots, they ought, in fair­\nness to the industrial inte1:ests of the country, to \nspeak firmly to, and what is more, act firmly with, \nsuch shop-keepers. Irish boots are entitled ·to a fair. \nfield and no favour in the shops of Ireland th.at deal in \nboots, and our readers should see as far as they reason• \nably may do so, that they get it. The boot manufac­\nturers of Ireland have rio right to ask the public for as \nmuch as,~ brass farthing for nothing, but they are en­\ntit~~!!. to a preference from the Irish buying public on \ntheir merits. We put the case this way :-It is common \nsense that the w:hole_ country benefits by the prosperity .. \nof the boot-makmg mdustry; the common-sense public \nwho read the LEADER are not asked -to make any sacri­\nfice for the sake of the special boot-making interest, but \nthey are, as common-sense, thinking people, asked to \nsee that they do not make a sacrifice for the benefit of \nBritish and American boot manufactm·ers; they a.re \nasked _to see t~at Irish-made boots get a fair field. We \nrepudiate the idea that they are entitled to any favour \nbeyond that, other things being equal, Irish boots, as \na matt~r of common sense, should ·get the preference \nfrom Irish boot _wearers ... We say that·eyery Irish boot \nshop should be m a pos1t1on. to show its customers fair \nsamples of the products of the several Irish boot factories. • \n. • The boot factory of Mr. Michael Governey, of Oarlow, \n1s a r«:_c~nt grow~h of the Industrial Revival. Mr . \nGov~rney . (tradm~ as Corcoran and Co.) is \nan extensive mmeral . water manufacturer also \na _manufl!,ctur~r, or _brewer, of hop bitters'. We \nspe~t several mtere~tmg hours looking over both fac­\ntories. Many of his mineral water machines are the \ninve~tion of _an Irishman, almost needless to say, the \n• 1Jart1cular Inshman had to go over to Britain _with his \nI \nl",

MAY 6; 1905. \nTHE LEADER AND THE LEAGUE-. \nI \nT is puerile, if ·not worse, on the part of the \n. . majority of the Gaelic League Executive present \nat ~he late meeting, to deprecate controversy on the \nsubJect of the outrage on Procession Sunday, when they \n~ave themselves created a situation- very plainly put \n. 1n the first paragraph of your last issue- which is simply \nuntena.ble and cannot possibly be brooked by the more \nstrenuous ·and straightforward Revivalists in the pro­\nvinces. The Executive must tell us once for all and \nin unequivocal languaae whether th~y endorse o~· un­\nqu~lifi.edly • condemn, the outrage in questio~1. The \nEditor of the ~EADER is quite competent to fight his \nown corner agamst any honourable antagonist, but he \ncannot be expected to go about armed with a life pre­\nserver .or a revolver to defend himself against every \nblackguard, who, backed up by kindred spirits of the • \ncorner-boy -class, substitutes physical force for intel­\nlectual argument. \nI submit, therefore, that in the present juncture, there \nshould be a strong expression of opinion in condemna­\ntion of the outrage, and the unsatisfactory action ·,f \nthe Executive, from the numerous and influential body \nof Irish Irelanders throughout the country who look \nto the militant LEADER as the exnonent \n0f their views and the most efficient organ of \nthe great National Revival as distinguished from that \nbrnnch of it--the Language Movement . Vve are, all 0f \nus, deeply interested in the Langu age Movemen t, and \nhave given and taken hard knocks on its account; but \nwhen we wanted, through the medium of _the press, to \nfurther its interests-to encourage its friends or to pil-• \nlory its e.nemies-it w as never to the official organ but \nto the LEADER that we looked for a platform. \nWhen the. LEADER first saw the light, the Language \nMovement had not yet emerged from the Catacombs . \nI well remember I was passing through the metropolis \nabout the time. I had occasio·n to call on a distin­\nguished member of one of the great Regular Orders­\nhim~elf a well-known literary man, and now head of an \nimportant house abroad. He it was that directed my \nattention to the LEADER, the first number of which was \nthen on:· the eve of appearing. At the same time he \ninquired what progress, if any, the Gaelic League was \nma.king in my neighbourhood. Well, I must confess, I \nscarce knew wh _at he meant , so little was known -of the \nLeague in the provinces at the time. And , though I \nhad twice in my previous life-as a mere ·boy of four-· \nt-een and as a man-taken up the study of Irish-I \ncould not tell whether, at the period to which I am re­\nferring, the Language Movement had an official organ \nat all, it was still sunk in such obscurity. But the \nbold and fearless an_d ,practical propaganda preached by \ntli.e LEADER appealed to the stronger spirits in the \nprovinces-whose motto was the verb \" to do,\" not' the \nverb \"to say \"-and the Gaelic League was quickly \nbrought to the light of day. • Branches sprang up every­\nwh_ere. The presidency of one, at-a ve1;y important \ncentre, w~s thrust on myself., much against my wishes. \nHowever, I took off my coat to the work, and within a \nshort period had-with the assistance of a few ener-\n·getic co-workers-the teaching of Irish introduced ·into \nall ~he schools i~ the neighbourho?d, with, perhaps,· an \nattendance of fifteen hundred · children, or more ' • and \ninside of eighteen months or so I personally colle~ted a \nsum running well into three figure~ for the support of \nthe Movement. • \nBut it was not all plain sailing.

MAY 6; 1905. \nTHE LEADER AND THE LEAGUE-. \nI \nT is puerile, if ·not worse, on the part of the \n. . majority of the Gaelic League Executive present \nat ~he late meeting, to deprecate controversy on the \nsubJect of the outrage on Procession Sunday, when they \n~ave themselves created a situation- very plainly put \n. 1n the first paragraph of your last issue- which is simply \nuntena.ble and cannot possibly be brooked by the more \nstrenuous ·and straightforward Revivalists in the pro­\nvinces. The Executive must tell us once for all and \nin unequivocal languaae whether th~y endorse o~· un­\nqu~lifi.edly • condemn, the outrage in questio~1. The \nEditor of the ~EADER is quite competent to fight his \nown corner agamst any honourable antagonist, but he \ncannot be expected to go about armed with a life pre­\nserver .or a revolver to defend himself against every \nblackguard, who, backed up by kindred spirits of the • \ncorner-boy -class, substitutes physical force for intel­\nlectual argument. \nI submit, therefore, that in the present juncture, there \nshould be a strong expression of opinion in condemna­\ntion of the outrage, and the unsatisfactory action ·,f \nthe Executive, from the numerous and influential body \nof Irish Irelanders throughout the country who look \nto the militant LEADER as the exnonent \n0f their views and the most efficient organ of \nthe great National Revival as distinguished from that \nbrnnch of it--the Language Movement . Vve are, all 0f \nus, deeply interested in the Langu age Movemen t, and \nhave given and taken hard knocks on its account; but \nwhen we wanted, through the medium of _the press, to \nfurther its interests-to encourage its friends or to pil-• \nlory its e.nemies-it w as never to the official organ but \nto the LEADER that we looked for a platform. \nWhen the. LEADER first saw the light, the Language \nMovement had not yet emerged from the Catacombs . \nI well remember I was passing through the metropolis \nabout the time. I had occasio·n to call on a distin­\nguished member of one of the great Regular Orders­\nhim~elf a well-known literary man, and now head of an \nimportant house abroad. He it was that directed my \nattention to the LEADER, the first number of which was \nthen on:· the eve of appearing. At the same time he \ninquired what progress, if any, the Gaelic League was \nma.king in my neighbourhood. Well, I must confess, I \nscarce knew wh _at he meant , so little was known -of the \nLeague in the provinces at the time. And , though I \nhad twice in my previous life-as a mere ·boy of four-· \nt-een and as a man-taken up the study of Irish-I \ncould not tell whether, at the period to which I am re­\nferring, the Language Movement had an official organ \nat all, it was still sunk in such obscurity. But the \nbold and fearless an_d ,practical propaganda preached by \ntli.e LEADER appealed to the stronger spirits in the \nprovinces-whose motto was the verb \" to do,\" not' the \nverb \"to say \"-and the Gaelic League was quickly \nbrought to the light of day. • Branches sprang up every­\nwh_ere. The presidency of one, at-a ve1;y important \ncentre, w~s thrust on myself., much against my wishes. \nHowever, I took off my coat to the work, and within a \nshort period had-with the assistance of a few ener-\n·getic co-workers-the teaching of Irish introduced ·into \nall ~he schools i~ the neighbourho?d, with, perhaps,· an \nattendance of fifteen hundred · children, or more ' • and \ninside of eighteen months or so I personally colle~ted a \nsum running well into three figure~ for the support of \nthe Movement. • \nBut it was not all plain sailing. Far from it. De­\ntermined opposition came from quarters, where a com­\nplete volte-face hafi since been executed.

In th~ mineral water and h_op bitter industries \nMr. Governey gives employment to no less than 60 or 70 \nhands i~ the summer months, and every one of these \nbegan as boy·s in his place. Mr. Governey .manufac­\nt~res a proportion of the corks he uses, and he builds \nhis OiWn vans--and he has 21 vans on the road. It is \nevident that he is not anxious to buy anything that \nhe Cil,n produce, a disposition that it would be well for \nthe country were it more prevalent. The business mind \n-of Ireland is now, happily, turning towards productive \nindustries, and thoug4 the material results, so far, \nmay not be great, yet they are many and considerable \nAbout two years ago, some priests and people in Carlow \nivere an.-.::ious that something new should be attempted \nin the industrial world, and there was a public meeting \n·.caJled. A bacon factory was suggested; but eventually \na boot .factory found most favour. Mr. Governey had \nan interview with Mr. T'. P. Gill and an expert was sent \n<down. There were thr!3e ways of attempting to start \nth~ .. :hoot factory. One was on the co-operative plan, \n.an9ther was by means of a public comp any, and· the \nthird was by starting it as a one-man concern. For­\ntunately, Mr .Governey was prepared to take the risk \n.all on his own shoulders, and so the site of an old ruin \nis now covered by a modern , well-equipped and compact \nfactory. The problem of production was a difficult one. \nFor the task that Mr. Michael Governey, an extensive \nmineral water manufacturer, took upon himself was to \n-start a boot factory, though he possessed no practical \n-experience in that line-and more than that, start it \nin a town in which the industry was previously un­\nknown. He first had to procure the services of some \npeople from the boot manufacturing centres of England, \n.and then the training of the native workers commenced . \nAnyone who has had any experience in the trials and \n• troubles of starting a new industry can readily apprP-­\n•ciate the difficulty of Mr . Governey 's task. Last \n'Thursday week we were over the factory. About 45 \nCarlow hands are now employed there, in addition lo \n.the few fully experienced hands whom Mr . Governey \n.brought over to teach the industry. As this is not a. \n. technical journal, any detailed reference to technical \nprocesses would be out of place. Needless to say the \nprinciple of the division of labour is largely availed of, \n·.and the employees work at various ingenious machines. \nThe girls work at a great table in· a room to them­\nselves. The appearance of the place was thoroughly \nbusiness like, and it was pleasant to watch young, newly \ntr~ined hands pushing on with their special division of \n. the now much divided operation of turning out a \n• machine-made boot. Nothing but leather is used, and \nMr. ··Governey 1s of course anxious to use as much Irish \ntanned leather as possible on business principles. Mr . \n,Governey, a keen business man as well as an Irishman \n,of public spirit, has now solved the problem of pr~­\n<lucing machine-made boots in a town where no suc11 \n. industry before existed. It is now for the common \nsense Irish public to lend a hand to help in the problem \nof disti·ibution. Mr. Governey asks no customer of \nhis to: sacrifice as much as a ha'penny in the way of \n.bolstering up Carlow-made boots. He sells as a busi­\n;ness man, and claini.s that his boots can be sold by the \n:retailer at competitive prices on the open market. \n. 'The fact that one of the great English distributing .firms \n'ithat have many branches in Ireland, are large pur­\nchasers of his boots, indicates their power to stand \nthe test of competition. Up to this, ladies and chil­\ndren's. boots have been practically the sole. out-put of \nthe, factory. Attention is now being given to men's \nlboots. For our part, though we aFe not experts, the \n·boots that we saw appeared to us as exceptional value \nat the prices at which they could be sold by retail \nfirms. The output at present is, we believe, about 500 \npairs weekly; within a reasonable time it· could be in­\n.creased to 1,500 pairs weekly, and after that-well, \nCarlow has plenty of room for extended factories, and \nMr. Michael Governey is an enterprising man . \nThere is plenty of room for a dozen, an:d many a \ndozen, more boot factories in Ireland. A new boot fac­\ntory is a benefit to existing factories. We remember \nover four years ago, when we were looking for informa­\ntion for our \".Nation Building '' article on boots, we \nheard much at Winstanley's great factory in Dublin, \nabout the inconveniences of the lack of an adequate \nIrish labour market in the boot industry. Now with \nthriving factories in Waterford, Cork, Belfast, Dublin \nand Carlow, that difficulty is being overcome; and \nwith a good supply of trained labour, the expansion of \nthe boot industry ought to· be comparatively easy in the \nfuture. • \nThere is no boot shop in Ireland that ought not to \nhave a stock of boots from one or more, if not all, the \nIrish boot factories. If a pmchaser goes into a shop \nand wishes to buy Irish boots on their merits, it is a \nshame that he is not given an opportunity to do so, and \nthe time has come when the consumers should again \nrouse themselves and do a hand's turn for Irish industry \nby talking to the shop-keepers for the shop-keepers' . \nown good. The boot manufacturers of Ireland. sell on \nmerits, and they deserve support on their merits; and \nit is very difficult for customers to give that support if \nshop after shop they go into have not a sufficient range \nof Irish-made boots in stock. \nThere is a busy go-a-head air about Carlow town that \nis in pleasant contrast to the tumble-clown appearance \nof too many other Irish towns. The \" beauty that \nhovers round decay \" is all very well in its way. The \nbeautiful and massive ruins of Carlow Castle stand in \nthe grounds of Mr. Michael Governey. But if he owns \nthe beautiful ruins of an ancient castle, he has founded \ntwo productive industries within reach of their shadows \nA HISTORY OF IRISH MUSIC.\" ' \nM \nR GRATI'AN FLOOD 'S \"History of Irish Music \" \nl has been received with a universal welcome, and I \ngiladly join m y voice in the general chorus of congratulation . \nTh e book is the work of a lifetime, the result of careful, \nprolonged, indefatig;i,ble research, and the amount of in­\nformation presented to the reader is, truly wonderful. \nBut while admitting frel'>ly the many merits of the book. \nthe critic must, as a duty, point otit some · draw-backs. \nTh ese are principally two-a want of style and a want· ·of \ncritical judgment. Under the first aspect the author can­\nnot be excused from a fair amount of carelessness. The· in­\nformation soom , sometimes to be thrown in simply in a \nheap, without any attempt at order. To give an example, \nwe get some infonnation about Ogham writing in two para­\ngraphs on pp. 2 and 3. In the next paragraph this subject \nis left, and afte,r learning something from MacFirbis' MS. \nBook of Genealogies and the Dinn Seanchils., we \"·come to \nthe close of tl1e third century, when we are on fairly solid \nhistorical ground.\" Immediately· we ai',e canied back,, in \nthe next paragraph, to the fifth century before Christ, and \nwe also learn something about the Galatians iri the time of \nSt. Jerome. Fina.Uy, a.ftar all these excursions, we come \nback to the subject of Ogham writing. I am glad to sa.y \nthat the later cha.pters of the book are more satisfactory, \nalthough here, too, information is sometimas thrown in \n\"aprop_os of \" sometl1ing. An annoying feature here, how-· \never, is the waste of valuable space by meaninglesi< repeti­\nt.ions. Thus, a sentence about a letter of Sir Henry Syd­\nney, given on p. 160, occurs verbatim again on n. 174. The \nconstitution of Queen Elizabeth's Band of Musick is given \nboth on p. 166 and p. 177. The object of the Charitable \nMusical Society is explained three times-pp. 266, 268, \nand 282. .And so on. \nMore serious, however, are the strictures I have to make \nunder. the second heading-want of critical judgment.

Now, I have·no \nfears on this score in regard to men of the John Martfo \nor Mitchell or Douglas Hyde stamp, whose co-operation \nis worth having, and for whom we have never been want ­\ning in respect and gratitude.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once.

As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore.

Nothing could \nstop the Suirside ploughmen, and the ball was in their midst, \ntenderly looked after, and adroitly manamvred by that \n\"foxiest\" of scriobs, Pete O'Hrtra. The Munster goal-keeper \nmade a frantic charge, but was brushed aside like a reed. \nWith a wild cheer that had rung before at Carrickshock, \non under the bar swept irresistible Moondharrig ! \nThe goal umpire waved a coloured flag. \"First goal for \nLeinster,\" he announced ! The Moondharrig men came out of \nthe melee flushed and smiling. The Moycullen veterans \npicked up their camans, astonishment depicted on their faces. \nIt was long since they had got such another mauling, but \nbeing old hands they took it good humouredly, their self­\nconfidence not being for an instant shaken. \nCaptain Roche was gloating to himself over the success of \nhis little ruse. His men, being now warmed up, might be \ndepended on to play the game of their lives and his fore­\nbodings of disastrous defeat were driven away. \nThe Moycullen goal man now \"pucked off\" and both \nteams settled down to work in earnest. It was a grand exhi­\nbition of the national game-the game of Cuchullin and of \nFinn, played with. consummate skill and coolness with never \na loss of temper on either side. The ball travelled up and \ndown the field with electrical velocity for quite a long time. \nThe backs on both sides seemed invulnerable to attack and sent \nthe leather back into midfield on every occasion. Among the \nyounger players Moran Og O'Laughlin so distinguished him­\nself by dashing and clever play as to win plaudits even from \nthe opposing crowd. Hartigan ''Aulinn\" had the satisfaction of \ncompletely out-playing his cousin, Kiernan Brennan, de­\nmoralizing that boastful individual by a few severe body­\nchecks and cowing him so that he left his proper position and \nwent to play on another part of the field. \nThe Moycullen veterans excelled in ground strokes, lift­\ning the ball every time and mostly taking it on the run. The \nTHE ALL-IRELAND CHAMPIONSEI.TP. 97 \nKilkenny men, using a shorter style of caman, were peculiarly \nskilful in \" raising \" and striking the ball in the air. \nThis last makes beautiful play for the spectators. The \nplayers flashed up and down the field, running like wild deer, \nand as they ran they struck at the ball bounding past, never \nmissing it once. Often, of course, two combatants met with a \nsounding crash, sometimes breaking their strong carnans. \nThe first half-hour of play was almost elapsed when the \nMunster men worked a surprise on their opponents. \" Whip \" \nSheridan and Shanahan, their two famous screebs, against \nwhom the Captain had repeatedly warned his men, had been \na long time looking for their opportunity. It came at last, and \nSheridan got the ball. He struck to Shanahan and Shanahan \nback to him. Dodging and twisting in the most bewildering \nmanner they succeeded in completely out-manceuvring the \nKilkenny backs. The cul-baire made a fine attempt to stop \nthem, and although the ball was shot on him at only five yards \ndistance he managed to meet it with his caman, but glancing \nobliquely the leather went through for a goal a -second or two \nbefore the whistle blew for the half time. \nThe Gaels, glad of a little rest, flung themselves down on \nthe sward wherever they happened to be. Here a green­\nshirted Moondharrig man might be seen in the very midst of \na strong company of Moycullen's, whose colours were \"black \nand amber.\" There at another spot the tables were turned, \nand a Moycullen Gael found himself surrounded by a verdant \ncircle of brawny Kilkenny men. But they got along famously \ntogether, and the sallies of Celtic wit that presently began to \nfly left the Gaels in exceeding good humour with each other. \nThe c~ptain walked leisurely over to the side lines where \nhe saw his friend, Meehal-na-Gamawn, standing. He was soon \nsmrounded by a crowd, many of whom proceeded to give him \npointers as to how the g/l.me should be played and how it \ncould be won. The Captain listened to these knowing ones \nwith a good-humoured smile, but he was heard to mutter an \nold Iri&h proverb under his breath-\"is maith an t-iomamiidhe \nan 'te bhionn ar an gclaidh \" (the best hurler is ever on the \nfence). The pride that shone in the eyes of Meehal-na-Gamawn, \nas he welcomed the Captain, was something worth seeing. \nH",

          "text": "The Road to Clonmel. \nTHE Moona.uarrig Gaels, with shouldered camans were march­\ning to the little railway station on their way to Clonmel to \nmeet the Munster men in the final for the Irish Championship. \nThe players were in ordered ranks and stepped with military \nprecision. Captain Dermot Roche scanned them appre­\nciatingly, and remarked, half aloud, that he considered the \nboys :we:e fit for anything \" from winning the championship \nto tackling a hundred peelers.\" The hurlers certainly de­\nserved this eulogy of the Captain's. \nFor the most part the sons of\" strong fa1·mers,\" they were \ntall, broad-shouldered and muscular to a surprising degree. \nTheir open, manly features were tanned by exposure to the \nsun and rain. All the long working week they had been busy \ntoiling in the rich level fields that are the pride and glory· of \nthe valley of the Suir. Each was a skilled ploughman, a \nveritable\" Matt the Thrasher,\" that with sharp-cleaving coulter \ncould cut a line from one given point to another '' as straight \nas a split in a peeler's poll.\" Notwithstanding their heavy \nwork, when practice day came they were light and agile as wild \ndeer on their feet, and no amount of running or play could \nfatigue them. These peasant Gaels were no carpet knights to \nencounter on the arena, as the city teams, unused to hard \nlabour, knew to their undoing. \nIn a short interval the Gaels arrived at the station, and to \npass the time leaped over the fence into an adjacent field and \nbegan to strike the ball in the manner called tri-na-ceile. \n, Then the skill of these trained manipulators was made \nevident. The superb handling of the caman was immediately \nto be recognised. \nThe short, swift telling strokes made the heavy leather \nsphere plunge and bound and soar as though of indiarubber. \nThe Captain, as usual, distinguished himself, and this time by \nTHE ROAD TO CLONMEL. 89 \na tremendous \"puck for height.\" The leather had come \nl'Ushing along the sward to Hartigan \"Aluinn,\" and he deftly \nreaching forward with his caman tossed it in the air, then \nswung a lightning stroke and the heavy sphere shot straight \nat the captain's breast ten yards away. But Dermot was on \nthe alert. It is almost impossible to strike a good hurler with \nthe ball if he has his caman in hand. Dermot Roche easily \nblocked the whizzing ball, raised it in air a foot or so, and then \n\"came under it\" with a smashing blow. The ball soared \nup straight and high till it seemed as ifabout to go out of sight \nin the atmosphere. - There was a hush of admiration and a \nperceptible pause before it descended. The Captain was wait­\ning fo1· it without having moved from his place. The \n\"mountain man,\" Hartigan'' Aluinn,'' was also waiting for its \ndescent. The two camans clashed together with terrible \nforce, and that of Hartigan's was shivered in two. A laugh \nwent up from the Gaels around. \" There, now, for you, \nHartigan; that'll teach you to leave the captain alone, you \nspailpin.\" A score such comments came from all sides. But \nthe boy from the mountains never heeded the good-natured \nchaffing of his friends. \nSadly he placed the two pieces of his burley together. \nAlas! there was no hope of an effective splice, and it wasn't \nsuch an easy feat to get the \" makins\" of a new one. As the \nArab loves his steed, as the coureur-du-bois loves his trusty \nrifle, so the Gael loves his favourite caman. \"I knew there was \na little crack in it,\" he mourned,\" but I didn't think tu'd go so \nsoon-an' I had it a long time-at Maryborough an' Wexford , \nan' Cork an' Dublin, an' I never knew a better piece of ash. \nI thought t'ud bring me through this season! I'm afraid \nthere's bad luck before me to-day.\" \n\"Don't be saying that, you big, soft amadan,\" said the \nCaptain cheerily. It's a lucky thing it broke; I'm going to \ngivlyou the last o' the Curraghmore hurleys-I brought it \nalong for a case like this. The whole four of them '11 be in \nthe game to-day.

          "text": "90 THE GAELS OF MOONDHARRIG. \nFogarty's masterpiece. The excursion train came along in \ndue time, and soon they were rushing by hamlets and green \nfields at a good rate of speed. Their way lay through the \nfertile and beautiful valley of the Suir, and the rich stretches \nof the famed Golden Vale spread out on the north and west. \nPast Carrick, and on toward \"rare Clonmel,\" the silvery Suir \nstill keeping close beside them. The Moondharrig men \nappreciated this companionship of their beloved river, recall­\ning tho many happy days and nights they had hauled the net \nupon its broad bosom. \nThey crossed the Anner, that classic stream immortalized \nby the poet Kickham, of idolized memory :-\n\" She lived beside the Anner, \nAt the foot of Slieve-na-mon, \nA gentle, pleasant girl, \nWith mild eyes like the dawn !\" \nDermot Roche was gazing out over mountain and valley, a \ndreamy look in his grey-blue Irish eyes, and the sad music of \nthe little ballad stole over his soul like a spell. Here, then, \nhad Charles Kickham planned and dreamed, and wasted away \nwith love for Ireland! The fields were beautifully soft and \ngreen, the streams crystalline; the dim and misty hills faded \na,way in the distance, dotted with white hamlets and shadowy \nwoods, suggestive of romance and legend. \nThe Captain had read and appreciated '· Knocnagowt \nthat true and unrivalled picture of southern Irish peasant life. \nAll the sweet sadness and sobbing laughter of that heart­\nmoving tale were in his soul as he gazed now upon the scenes \nit describes. \nIn one of those far away little villages whose white­\nwashed walls shone through the hazy distance, that sweet \nsaint, Norah Lahy, had faded away in the bloom of her youth, \n\"a blossom plucked for heaven.\" • There the inimitable Barney \nBrodherick had flourished and sported-on the strength of the \ntwo shillings worth of dance he got from Callaghan, cutting \nweird and fantastic capers as he \"welted\" the floor at Ned \nBrophy's wedding. There, too, \"Matt the Thrasher,\" the great \nploughman and athlete, the typical Tipperary man, had per­\nformed his wondrous feat of defeating Captain French at the \nTHE ROAD TO CLONlvfEL. 91 \nhammer-throwing contest. On that occasion Matt Donovan \nhad debated with himself as to whether he ought to allo,v the \nCaptain to \"have the majority\" or not, but the sight of the \nlittle village in the distance determined him, and for its credit \neclipsed all records. Captain Roche's cheeks tingled now as \nhe thought of another little village far away whose \"credit,. \ndepended on himself to-day. \nThen the swelling sides of Slieve-na-mon caught his eye, \nand he was in the dreamy past again. This mountain from his \n• earliest years had a charm and a fascination of its own for \nCaptain Roche. \nRising iu solitary magnificence, dominating the Golden \nVale, and overlooking the sinuous curves of the winding Suir, \nit was a most conspicuous object seen from the native village. \nIt was sufficiently remote for one of an imaginative tem­\nperament to fancy it an enchanted mountain in the midst of \nfairyland, and Slieve-na-mon in its varying moods lent itself \nlovingly to the illusion. In the wonderful Irish atmosphere \nwhat varied shades and tints it assumed-now azure blue, like \nthe vault of heaven, now deeper-hued like the pulsing ocean; \nanon dark threatening and cloud-veiled, and again fair-smiling \nin the sun's warm caresses, showing vesture of green field, \nbrown heather-belt and golden-crowning gorse. And ever was \nit associated in his boyish mind with the shadowy past of \nErin ! Not only was it the chosen dwelling-place of the fairies, \nbut also, it was haunted by the mighty shades of prehistoric \nheroes, of Cuchullin and Conall Cearnach, of Finn and Oisin \nand Oscar! \nThe slow-moving mists upon its broad breast were the hosts \nof the Fianna and ~he fear-compelling Red Branch, sweeping \nforward in resistless battle array, and the reverberating \nthunder-peal was the shock of the onset, and the rattle of \nbuckler and shield. The gray mountain looks down into \n\"Cashel of the Kings,\" and what scenes of splendour and \nwarlike pomp it must have viewed in Erin's·\" olden, golden .­\ndays \"-the mustering of the Dalcassian and Eugenian bat­\ntalions, the royal conclaves of the Mononian Kings, their \ncontests, their feasts and revelries, whereat a hundred harps \nclashed in swelling diapason!",

Later on, the turbulent Normans­\nDe Burgo of Clanricard, Butler of Ormond, and the haughty \nGeraldines of Kildare marched and counter-marched, fought \ndoughty battles, and reduced proud fortresses on the broad \nplains spreading below; and \"Murrough the Burner\" passed, \nleaving behind a black and desolate trail:-\nMurrough the Burner, from Croome to Connaught, \nI see the smeke of your conquest rise, \nMaddened with slaughter, your k~rne and bonnaght, \nAffright our valleys with murderous cries, \nLav Laic/Jtir Abu! \nThe dumb bea~t e'en -from their presence flies, \nLav Laidhir Abu! \nThe Captain's reverie was broken by a shout of \"Clonmel\" as \nthe train slowed down, and the strains of a brass band became \naudible. The hurlers were received with welcoming cheers, \nand lining up behind the band ma1·cbed out to the hurling \ngrounds. • \nClonmel, the place to which, as readers of Kickham will \n:remember, Billy Heffernan brought the load of turf-\" Clo'mel, \nthe town with the cloud over it,\" is prettily situated on the \nSuir in the middle of a rich and smiling country. The \nMoondharrig men had pleasant memories of it and of its \npeople, having previously visited it on many occasions. The \ntownsfolk for their part gazed on the hurlers with unfeigned \ninterest, as Moondharrig's fame was well known to them, and \nthe spirited march past of the Gaels to the strains of \" The \nWearing of the Green\" was a sight worth seeing. \nA great sq Ufl.re field outside the town had been prepared \nfor the occasion. Six or seven thousand people had assembled \nto watch the contest. Green flags flaunted gaily from th~ \ngoal posts, and a good-humoured and orderly crowd cheered \nthe arriving teams. The towering physique of the \" gallant \nTipperary\" boys, and the fresh bloom and grace of the cailins \nwere immediately evident. Of course, as everywhere else, the \n\"Aunt Sally\" man was there, with stentorian voice, calling \nupon all and sundry to take \"three shots a penny\" at the \nTHE ROAD TO CLONMEL. 93 \nempty bottles which he placed on a \"cock-shot\" for that pur­\npose. The trick-o' -the-loop man was at large among the \nfarmers' boys, and the man who put his head out of a barrel \nand dared one to hit the head was ducking from some well­\naimed throws. \nHe certainly. deserved all the pennies he got, for his head \nwas in imminent jeopardy every time he winked his eyelids, \nand if he winked twice in succession he was lost, for the \n\"Tipps\" are not called \"stone-throwers\" for nothing. \nThe Munster picked hurlers were already on the ground \nprepared for action. Tall, agile, wiry youths they were, look­\ning to have an unlimited supply of speed and endurance. \nThey were dallying a little with the ball by way of practice, \nand their handling of the ca.man showed the unmistakable \ntouch of players brought up to it from earliest boyhood. \nThe Moondharrig men were not long in getting ready for \nthe fray. \nStripping off to their green jerseys, and tightening their \ngrip of the cam,ans, they went into the field picking their \nsteps, like the light-footed \"Kilkenny Cats\" they were. A \ngreat silence berran to settle down on the crowds-the excite-, n \nment was spreading to them, and expectancy was upon every \nface. The gaze of all was on the two famous teams now \napproaching one another. \nThe Captain spoke a last word to his men in a low tone. \n\"Now, boys, let us do our best. We cau beat them if we only \nkeep our heads-don't mind the crowds, and keep your eye on \nthe ball. Have no fear of the Munster men-there are no men \nthat can handle. a caman better than the Moondharrig men. \nDon't forget that thelre all prayin' for us at home, and let us \nbring good news to the little village by the river\"--\nThe referee's whistle cut in sharp and clear and the \nforty-two Gaels lined up for the All-Ireland Championship \nMatch.",

Placed man on man, each \nplayer took the end of his opponent's caman in his hand, and \ntwo officials elevating a rod over the hurler's heads, counted \nthem off in couples. \nThe Gaels in the meantime were measuring each other \nwith their eyes. This was a long-looked for moment, as the \nfame of the two teams had gone afar through the land. The \nMoycullens, Munster champions, were the taller men, but were \nnot so heavy-framed as the stalwart Suirside ploughman, and \nthe former seemed more confident and more at home on \nthe field. \nThe Moondharrig men never could get rid of a certain \nanxiety and nervousness before and during the first few \nminutes of a match, and with sharp opponents to take account \nof this, notable advantages might be gained over them. \nCaptain Roche feared for this, but his dependance on the cul­\nbaire, Will Hanlon, a veteran between the posts, was strong \nand well-founded. \nThe goal•man was standing close beside the Captain, and \nthe latter admired the sang froid of his lieutenant. \nHeartily slapping the powerful custodian of the posts u~on \nthe back, Roche cried\" M'anam asther hu-Hanlon, I wish \nthey were all as solid as you, but save us till the boys' blood is \nup, an' we'll leave you little to do after that.\" . . \n\"I'll do id, Captain, never fear,\" and the grim cul baire \ngrinned reassuringly. \nThen there was a cry of \" ball in play \" and a clash of \ncamans like a musket volley. The referee had suddenly rolled \nthe ball down the line of players; the backs flew to position, \nand the match was on! \nTHE ALL-IRELAND CHAMPIONSHIP. 95 \nThe ball was held at centre for some exciting seconds. \nThe on-looking crowds, hitherto silent, broke into a frenzy of \ncries for the opposing teams-\" Moondharrig go bragh,\" con­\nflicted with cries of \"Moycullen Abu\" and \"Munster to the \nfront-clear the way.\" \nThe music of the camans was inspiring to listen to. They \nclicked and slashed; the knot of players swayed and struggled, \nthen suddenly broke. The ball got loose and was swiftly \ntaken possession of by Munster. Like a whirlwind it was \nswept towards Moondharrig's goal. Then the Captain's fears \nwere partly realised. The Kilkenny men tried to stop the \nattack, but in their nervousness fumbled and missed one after \nanother. The ball zig-zagged a bit, then two swift stroke sent \nit in like a bullet on the cul bai1·e. \nHad there been an ordinary goal-man between the posts \nMunster would assuredly have scored, but Hanlon was the best \ngoal-man in the South, and was well on the alert. As the \nsphere plunged in breast high he swung on it viciously \nand with faultless aim. There was a short, sweet \"click\" and \nthe leather soared back as if shot from a catapult! \nDermot Roche was angry with his men. They had gone \nto pieces before that splendid Munster rush, and something \nwas needed to \"get their blood up\" or the game might \nbe lost. Now, there was a certain local term of reproach \nwhich, when applied to the Suirside men, never failed to \narouse their anger and combativeness. Above the noises of the \nfield the stentorian voice of the Captain rang out-\" Wake up, \nMoondharrig ! the Munster men are calling ye cabbage \neaters! \" \nThe Moondharrig men pricked up their ears at the hate­\nful name-cabbage eaters, eh ? They would soon show them !\" \nThe ball at this moment was in the possession of the \n.M:oondharrig left wing, and the left wing flared up in a trice \nlike a swarm of angry bees. With short, lightning strokes, \nplaying beautiful combination, they took it down the field \ntowards the Moycullen goal. Their heavy centre rush, sweep­\ning everything from its way, bore down parallel with them, to \nreceive the ball when the wings thought well of giving it up.",

Nothing could \nstop the Suirside ploughmen, and the ball was in their midst, \ntenderly looked after, and adroitly manamvred by that \n\"foxiest\" of scriobs, Pete O'Hrtra. The Munster goal-keeper \nmade a frantic charge, but was brushed aside like a reed. \nWith a wild cheer that had rung before at Carrickshock, \non under the bar swept irresistible Moondharrig ! \nThe goal umpire waved a coloured flag. \"First goal for \nLeinster,\" he announced ! The Moondharrig men came out of \nthe melee flushed and smiling. The Moycullen veterans \npicked up their camans, astonishment depicted on their faces. \nIt was long since they had got such another mauling, but \nbeing old hands they took it good humouredly, their self­\nconfidence not being for an instant shaken. \nCaptain Roche was gloating to himself over the success of \nhis little ruse. His men, being now warmed up, might be \ndepended on to play the game of their lives and his fore­\nbodings of disastrous defeat were driven away. \nThe Moycullen goal man now \"pucked off\" and both \nteams settled down to work in earnest. It was a grand exhi­\nbition of the national game-the game of Cuchullin and of \nFinn, played with. consummate skill and coolness with never \na loss of temper on either side. The ball travelled up and \ndown the field with electrical velocity for quite a long time. \nThe backs on both sides seemed invulnerable to attack and sent \nthe leather back into midfield on every occasion. Among the \nyounger players Moran Og O'Laughlin so distinguished him­\nself by dashing and clever play as to win plaudits even from \nthe opposing crowd. Hartigan ''Aulinn\" had the satisfaction of \ncompletely out-playing his cousin, Kiernan Brennan, de­\nmoralizing that boastful individual by a few severe body­\nchecks and cowing him so that he left his proper position and \nwent to play on another part of the field. \nThe Moycullen veterans excelled in ground strokes, lift­\ning the ball every time and mostly taking it on the run. The \nTHE ALL-IRELAND CHAMPIONSEI.TP. 97 \nKilkenny men, using a shorter style of caman, were peculiarly \nskilful in \" raising \" and striking the ball in the air. \nThis last makes beautiful play for the spectators. The \nplayers flashed up and down the field, running like wild deer, \nand as they ran they struck at the ball bounding past, never \nmissing it once. Often, of course, two combatants met with a \nsounding crash, sometimes breaking their strong carnans. \nThe first half-hour of play was almost elapsed when the \nMunster men worked a surprise on their opponents. \" Whip \" \nSheridan and Shanahan, their two famous screebs, against \nwhom the Captain had repeatedly warned his men, had been \na long time looking for their opportunity. It came at last, and \nSheridan got the ball. He struck to Shanahan and Shanahan \nback to him. Dodging and twisting in the most bewildering \nmanner they succeeded in completely out-manceuvring the \nKilkenny backs. The cul-baire made a fine attempt to stop \nthem, and although the ball was shot on him at only five yards \ndistance he managed to meet it with his caman, but glancing \nobliquely the leather went through for a goal a -second or two \nbefore the whistle blew for the half time. \nThe Gaels, glad of a little rest, flung themselves down on \nthe sward wherever they happened to be. Here a green­\nshirted Moondharrig man might be seen in the very midst of \na strong company of Moycullen's, whose colours were \"black \nand amber.\" There at another spot the tables were turned, \nand a Moycullen Gael found himself surrounded by a verdant \ncircle of brawny Kilkenny men. But they got along famously \ntogether, and the sallies of Celtic wit that presently began to \nfly left the Gaels in exceeding good humour with each other. \nThe c~ptain walked leisurely over to the side lines where \nhe saw his friend, Meehal-na-Gamawn, standing. He was soon \nsmrounded by a crowd, many of whom proceeded to give him \npointers as to how the g/l.me should be played and how it \ncould be won. The Captain listened to these knowing ones \nwith a good-humoured smile, but he was heard to mutter an \nold Iri&h proverb under his breath-\"is maith an t-iomamiidhe \nan 'te bhionn ar an gclaidh \" (the best hurler is ever on the \nfence). The pride that shone in the eyes of Meehal-na-Gamawn, \nas he welcomed the Captain, was something worth seeing. \nH",

That was now the question. \nMunster was hurling in brilliant form and repeatedly \nthreatened the Leinster posts, but the defonce of the Moond. \nharrig backs was phenomenal. Malachy Gilmartin was easily \nparamount among the latter. The young woodranger's charges \nwere irresistible, and his powerful strokes, lifting the ball clear \nand high over the imush, repeatedly baffled the dashing efforts \nput forth by Moycullen. At this juncture the ball went over \nthe side lines, and a minute or so elapsed before it was re­\ncovered. Captain Roche slipped quietly down to the forward \nline where screeb.man O'Hara stood to attention. cc Keep an \neye on me, now, and be ready for us any minute, Pete.\" \n\"I'll watch you like a fox, Captain,\" rejoined O'Hara; \n\"you may depend your life on me.\" \nIt had now come to the last five minutes and the players \nseemed to redouble their efforts. The confidence ofMoycullen \nwas unshaken, and they clearly expected to win. But a \nsurprise was in store for them. Moran Og O'Laughlin, by \nbrilliant play at centre, captured the ball and like a flash shot \nit across the field, away from the mass of players.

'' I remember the day ye played \nthe men o' Conna,ught, when you made that great play at \ncentre, one of the Connaught backs, a big giant of a fellow, ran \nhalf the length o' the field to get at you. But just as he got \nto you Moran Og, God rest his soul, went at him wud' a heavy \nbody-check an' they rolled over together two or three times. \nMoran tould me after that his shoulder an' ribs were sore for a \nillonth, but he didn't c0,re as long as he saved the Captain.\" \n\"He was the pluckiest boy on the team, Meehal,\" said the \nCaptain, emphatically. \"He didn't know what fear was, an' \nmaybe the poor fellow 'd be alive to-day if he wasn't ~o hot­\nheaded an' brave. I'll never forget the way he rode through \nthe peelers at Carrick the day they were tryin' to arrest William \nO'Brien-God bless him-I was right there on the spot, an' \nwhen I saw Moran chargin' on that wild horse he had, I thought \nhe was done for; There were two lines o' police with fixed \nbayonets, but he rode through 'em without a scratch, though \ntwo of the bayonets cut through his.clothes.\" \n\"He was fond of a harmless joke too,\" put in Malaehy \nGillllartiu. \"He often made me laugh tellin' about Peter \nHoran's coortin'-Peter, you know, never was a great hand at \nconversin', and when he went to see Molly Dunphy-that'• \nhis wife now-they used to meet at the big log near W a,lshe's \ni;:.:ate. Peter would sit on one end o' the log and Molly on the \nTHE BURIAL OF MORAN 0G. 105 \nother, an' not a wo1J 'd pass between 'em, but every five \nminnits or so Peter 'ud turn to her an' say: 'Well isn't it a \nfright of a fine night Molly ? '\" \n\"The old father feels terrible about id,\" said Pete O'Hara, \n,, 'Tis his death blow I'm afeared. He was that proud o' him \nthe poor old man, he used to follow the team everywhere to \nsee Moran play. I mind one match in Dublin against Meath. \nMoran an' another player got jostlin' an' they wern't long at \nid when the old man came in on the ground with a black­\nthorn, wild to take the boy's part, an' he that quiet at home he \nwouldn't speak to the old druimin dubh.\" \n\"No use in t[l,lkin', it's a hard world,' commented Meehal­\nna-Gamawn, \"there's the poor old man all alone now at the ind \nof his days.\" \nAs the funeral had by this time arrived at the graveyard \nour four friends went forward to bell,r the remains to their last \nresting-place. The graveyard had formerly belonged to \nan abbey, part of whose walls gray with uncounted years was \nstill standing. Gigantic elm and ash trees surrounded the \nplace, and the breeze stirred their moaning branches into a. \nsolemn dirge for the dead. \nSeveral tombstones, green and tottering with age scattered \naround, and a venerable Celtic Cross, mournful relic of the dim \npast, after the storms of centuries still stood bravely erect. It \nwas indeed a solemn and lonely place, and at night when the \nmournful face of the moon looked at one through the broken \nabbey windows, and the shadow of the Celtic Cross fell darkly \no'er the moss-covered stones, thoughts of death and the here­\nafter, sombre thoughts impossible to express came into the \nmind. \nAs Dermot Roche and his companions bore the coffin in, and \nlaid it by the empty grave, Moran Og's father, a bent and \ngray-haired old man, burst into a passionate lament, unburden­\ning his great sorrow in the expressive Gaelic tongue : \n\"Moran, a mhic mo chroidhe, bh-/uil tu marbh? bh-/uil \ntu marbh.\" (Moran son of my heart, are you dead ? are you \ndead). Oh, vein of my heart, light of my eyes, treasure of my \nyears, and do you know who they are that carry you to your \nlong sleep ? They are the friends of your heart with whom",

Often have you played together on the \nbawn, and your feet was as swift as the wolf-hounds, your eye \nsure, and your arm strong and skilled to strike the ball through \nthe posts, mo chroidhe. They'll miss you, Moran a, mhic, on \nthe hurling field, but your old father will miss you more than \nall! \n\"'Tis you that were the comfort of his life, and earned the \nbread for his eating. The horses heeded your voice in the \nploughing-field and the furrow you made was straight as a \nbeam of the rainy sun. The people passing stopped to admire \nthe straight, smooth-turned sods and to hear your cheery \ngreeting when you turned at the headland. They'll miss you \nfrom field and headland, but mo bh1·on, I'll miss you more \nthan all. \n\"Three nights ago a, mhic-mo chroide coming from Port­\nlaw Fair along the banks of the Suir, near the old castle of \nGurtheen I heard the Banshee cry aloud in the night. . \n\"Och a,nee ! but 'twas a bitter cry, and the flesh ofmy \nheart shook and the sweat came out on my brow with the woe \nand loneliness of it. Moran Dhilish I prayed to God's Son \nthat died for us that you might not be taken, but myself \ninstead, an old broken man. \n\"H 0 willed it otherwise~a.ye-but did He will it?\" Here \na terrible change came upon the affiicted father, a whirlwind \nof passion shook him, his face grew dark and scowling, his \nvoice loud and strident, so that many of the people fell away \nfrom him in terror. \n\"Ay did He will it? No! You were murdered, my \nnoble boy. They murdered you, the hounds of hell, the \nheartless Sassenach ! May the curse of a heart-broken father \nfall on the English dogs that tracked you to death.\" \nGoing on his knees by his son's grave the unhappy man \nnow poured forth the most awful maledictions on England, \nand the British government which he held responsible for his \nson'a death. As he poured forth these terrible imprecations a \nsort of silent a we fell on the crowd. No one stirred until at \nlast Dermot Roche approached and touching the old man on \nthe shoulder said quietly: \nTHE BURIAL OF MORAN OG. 107 \n\"•Tis time for the prayer now, sir, we have the grave \nfilled in.\" \nAt the touch O'Laughlin stood up and looked around him \nwildly, like one awakening from a horrible dream. \n\"The prayer\" he gasped. \"Of course-the prayer.\" Then \nina piteous cry'' Oh Moran, a 1nhic, my innocent boy, have I \nbeen cursing over your grave, you that never hurt man or \nbeast, that never had a bad word in your mouth? Forgive \nme, oh God, and you Moran down in the cold clay, forgive \nme-forgive-\" \nThe old man suddenly put his hand to his forehead, \nstaggered uncertain for a moment-tried again to speak, then \nwith a low, weak cry fell insensible into the strong arms of the \nCaptain of the Hurlers",

      "raw_text": "96 THE GAELS OF MOONDHARRIG. \nBut the wings never gave up the ball until they surged \ninto the centre mass twenty yards in front of the goal. \nLike victims to the car of Juggernaut the Munster backs \nplunged in but sacrificed themselves in vain. Nothing could \nstop the Suirside ploughmen, and the ball was in their midst, \ntenderly looked after, and adroitly manamvred by that \n\"foxiest\" of scriobs, Pete O'Hrtra. The Munster goal-keeper \nmade a frantic charge, but was brushed aside like a reed. \nWith a wild cheer that had rung before at Carrickshock, \non under the bar swept irresistible Moondharrig ! \nThe goal umpire waved a coloured flag. \"First goal for \nLeinster,\" he announced ! The Moondharrig men came out of \nthe melee flushed and smiling. The Moycullen veterans \npicked up their camans, astonishment depicted on their faces. \nIt was long since they had got such another mauling, but \nbeing old hands they took it good humouredly, their self­\nconfidence not being for an instant shaken. \nCaptain Roche was gloating to himself over the success of \nhis little ruse. His men, being now warmed up, might be \ndepended on to play the game of their lives and his fore­\nbodings of disastrous defeat were driven away. \nThe Moycullen goal man now \"pucked off\" and both \nteams settled down to work in earnest. It was a grand exhi­\nbition of the national game-the game of Cuchullin and of \nFinn, played with. consummate skill and coolness with never \na loss of temper on either side. The ball travelled up and \ndown the field with electrical velocity for quite a long time. \nThe backs on both sides seemed invulnerable to attack and sent \nthe leather back into midfield on every occasion. Among the \nyounger players Moran Og O'Laughlin so distinguished him­\nself by dashing and clever play as to win plaudits even from \nthe opposing crowd. Hartigan ''Aulinn\" had the satisfaction of \ncompletely out-playing his cousin, Kiernan Brennan, de­\nmoralizing that boastful individual by a few severe body­\nchecks and cowing him so that he left his proper position and \nwent to play on another part of the field. \nThe Moycullen veterans excelled in ground strokes, lift­\ning the ball every time and mostly taking it on the run. The \nTHE ALL-IRELAND CHAMPIONSEI.TP. 97 \nKilkenny men, using a shorter style of caman, were peculiarly \nskilful in \" raising \" and striking the ball in the air. \nThis last makes beautiful play for the spectators. The \nplayers flashed up and down the field, running like wild deer, \nand as they ran they struck at the ball bounding past, never \nmissing it once. Often, of course, two combatants met with a \nsounding crash, sometimes breaking their strong carnans. \nThe first half-hour of play was almost elapsed when the \nMunster men worked a surprise on their opponents. \" Whip \" \nSheridan and Shanahan, their two famous screebs, against \nwhom the Captain had repeatedly warned his men, had been \na long time looking for their opportunity. It came at last, and \nSheridan got the ball. He struck to Shanahan and Shanahan \nback to him. Dodging and twisting in the most bewildering \nmanner they succeeded in completely out-manceuvring the \nKilkenny backs. The cul-baire made a fine attempt to stop \nthem, and although the ball was shot on him at only five yards \ndistance he managed to meet it with his caman, but glancing \nobliquely the leather went through for a goal a -second or two \nbefore the whistle blew for the half time. \nThe Gaels, glad of a little rest, flung themselves down on \nthe sward wherever they happened to be. Here a green­\nshirted Moondharrig man might be seen in the very midst of \na strong company of Moycullen's, whose colours were \"black \nand amber.\" There at another spot the tables were turned, \nand a Moycullen Gael found himself surrounded by a verdant \ncircle of brawny Kilkenny men. But they got along famously \ntogether, and the sallies of Celtic wit that presently began to \nfly left the Gaels in exceeding good humour with each other. \nThe c~ptain walked leisurely over to the side lines where \nhe saw his friend, Meehal-na-Gamawn, standing. He was soon \nsmrounded by a crowd, many of whom proceeded to give him \npointers as to how the g/l.me should be played and how it \ncould be won. The Captain listened to these knowing ones \nwith a good-humoured smile, but he was heard to mutter an \nold Iri&h proverb under his breath-\"is maith an t-iomamiidhe \nan 'te bhionn ar an gclaidh \" (the best hurler is ever on the \nfence). The pride that shone in the eyes of Meehal-na-Gamawn, \nas he welcomed the Captain, was something worth seeing. \nH",
