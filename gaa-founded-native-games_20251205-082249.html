I remember Tull playing an All-Ireland Football\nFinal with Clare against Wexford in 1917. He was then only a mere\nlad. Silvy played with London Irish, and kept up the family reputation\nin the city of the Big Fog. Brendan saw his best days in Dublin with\nthe Geraldines and Collegians, although as a boy he had helped Clare\nin their first All-Ireland hurling final away back in 1914. I frequently\nmeet Brendan in my travels, and he is still the same genial personality,\ntaking’ as keen an interest as ever in the games of the Gael. His last\nappearance on the field was against Tipperary in Cork, for the 1930\nMunster Final. Tull made history, in the sensational Clare-Galway clash\nat Limerick for the 1932 All-Ireland Hurling Semi-final. And I must\nnot forget to mention three others of the family, less known to fame,\nbut like their brothers, a trio of workers who gave noble service in the\ncause of native games. Pat was captain of the London Dalcassians and\nkept the game going amongst the exiles in London. Joe, who has\nwritten some beautiful lyric poetry, also wielded a stout caman and\nplayed inter county junior for Dublin, whilst Diarmuid, the youngest\nlimb of the family tree, was also prominent in junior Metropolitan\nhurling nearly thirty years ago.",

Hard luck in the early part of a contest troubled him not, in fact it only made him put greater heart into his game. Again and again in his big “ scores” he smiled with honest confidence in the face of the mighty handicap of two bowls odds half-way through, and it was often m the last throw that he landed “the goods” for his adoring backers. His matches are well remembered by all followers of the game south of the Blackwater. “Buck,” too, has found his way to and con- tinues his fame in, Yankee land. When McGrath was in his prime he met with an unexpected defeat in a big score with a fine cut of a young bowler—Jim Barrett, of the south side. Barrett stood six feet one, and was an Adonis in mould. He was cool, canny, strong, and just the man to lower McGrath's colours. Barrett continued to win everywhere after McGrath left Ireland, and landed no less than twelve successive “big” scores inside a few years. Then came fhe one and only Paddy Murphy, of Waterloo, a young giant of six feet three in his stockinged feet, with a style that combined ease and strength to a wonderful degree, and with a loft that only Driscoll in his prime could equal. Though Barrett’s greater experience told in the early matches, Murphy’s shyness gradually wore away, and in the last big “score” played in the Cork liberties he proved himself a real champion on a road that suited him but little. Murphy is still the generally acknowledged bowling champion, and with his privilege of venue (for he will now chose a wide road) he is not likely to be beaten for years. The only likely candidates for championship honours outside the veteran Jim Barrett are the well-known athletes, W. F. Bennett, D. O'Leary, Coppeen, and Jack Driscoll, of Clondrohid.

Handball should be insisted on at once and a court or alley made an essential part of the school equipment. Beyond some two dozen scattered enthusiasts, Gaelic games are neglected by the controllers of our secondary schools. This important section of the G.A.A. curriculum has been criminally neglected by the official bodies of the Association. Much good work has been done in Dublin and Cork. Half-a-dozen colleges through the country are working hard for the popularity of native codes, but the vast majority of our educational authorities are either apathetic or un- friendly. I anticipate immediate improvement in this direction, but the driving force must come from within the Association, which is wide-flung and enfluential enough to direct the physical-education policy of the country. Let our boys and young men be good Irishmen first, and good men after. One will necessarily follow the other, for py good Irishmen I mean clean-living, industrious, honourable men who will be a credit to their native country, and help to build up her broken fortunes.",

A public \nmeeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce with a \nview to promoting this Munster and Connacht industrial \n- enterprise. The meeting was a very representative one. \nFather J. M. Cl·egan, Adm ., to whose energy is to be \ncredited the St. Itas' Shirt Factory of Limerick, E. Cole \n~elson, James Flynn, City High Sheriff; G. Spillane, \nAlderman S. O'Mara, F. 0. Cle.eve, J.P.; R. Gibson, \nSir Charles Barrington, M. O'Gallaghan, Gerald Good­\nbody, T. Geary, E.. J. Long, M. D. Shaw, David Tid­\nmarsh, J . S. Gaffney, Solr.; J. O'Grady Delmege, D .L. ; \nRev. John Lee, C.C .. ; W. F. M'Namara--these various \nclasses of men were amongst those present, and their \nnames indicate the broad and representative basis upon \nwhich the proposed exhibition in July of next year is \nto be carried out. \nMr. T. A. Ferguson proposed \"that an Industrial \nExhibition be held in Limerick, opening the first week \nin July, 1906, to be called 'The Munster and Connacht \nIndustrial Exhibition.\" In supporting this resolution \nMr. James S. Gaffney, Solr., in the course of his re­\nmarks as reported in the ~/Jfunster 1Yews, said:-\" It was \na great pity that they, Limerick people, and Irish \npeople as a whole, especially in the South of Ireland, \nshould not rely sufficiently on themselves, and show that \nreliance by buying where they could goods made in Ire­\nland that were as good and cheap as goods made else­\nwhere (hear, hear). He_ had 3:dopted the practice in his \nown household of buymg Irish-manufactured goods. \nThe crux was, would things be got as good and as cheap \nin Ireland as elsewhere, and in that relation he had seen \na most interesting corresp01idence in a newspaper with \nsome of the views of which many people did not agree­\nhe meant the Dublin LEADER, which had done au enor­\nmous amount of good for the manufacturers of Ireland \n(hear, bear)-a correspondence a~ to _whether people \nshould buy Irish goods even at prices higher than those \npaid for the foreign goods, and he saw that the vas~ ma­\njority, of the manufacturers of Ireland were unammous \nin saying that they did not want any patronage on t~e \ngrouud that they were Irish mauufactul'Crs-they chcl \nnot want anybody to buy goods from them excep~ they \nwere as good and as cheap as goods manufactured many \npart of the world (hear, hear). If they put that forward \nin supporting this Exhibition, it would be a success.\" \nA Committee consisting of the E ,xecutive of the Lime­\nrick Industrial Association and the following-with \npower to adcl to their numbers--were appointed to carry \nout the arrangements for the. Munster and Connacht \nExhibition of 1906 :-Sir Thomas Cleave, Messrs. J. E. \nGoodbody, Archibald Murray, James Quin, Samu 'el Lee, \nWilliam Lloyd, David Tidmarsh, John Egan, A. Bar­\nnett, W. L. Stokes, P. E. Bourke together with the \nManagers of the five Banks in the city. \nThere was a \" Grand Christy Minstrel \" entertain­\nment and· concert at St. lVfary's Temperance Hall, Irish­\ntown, Glomnel. A programme of the great event is \nbefore us. The strenuous, manly and self-respecting \nmajority at a recent meeting of the Executive of the \nGaelic League in Dublin should look after the Olonmel \nniggers. 1'hey had no Irish vocal items, nay,, even \nmore, they had no Anglo-Irish vocal item at their enter­\ntainment at St. Mary's Temperance Hall, Irishtown, \nOlonmel, and yet no \"unauthorised persons\" even \n·\" held up\" Bones I • One of the niggers sang \"Looking \nfor a Coon like me.\" vVho was looking for him 7 As \nwe are persons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" perhaps \nwe have no right to intrude our enquiries into such mat­\nters. Why should we ask questions of Coons if we may \nnot ask a question of the Central Body of the Gaelic \nLeague? There are possibly \" unauthorised \" Coons \nas well as \" unauthorised\" Gaelic L~aguers I And if the \nGaelic League authorities are above criticism, why \nshould not the Coons, also, be exempt 7 Very Rev. \nCanon Flavin, P .P., au Irish speaker, is Director of the \nT em perance Sodality, but Canon Flavin is not respon­\nsible for this un-Irisb programme. We are informed \nthat Canon Flavin, with his own money acquired two \nhouses (one of them a drunkery, the licence of which he \nextinguished). These two houses he reconstructed, ex­\ntended, furnished, fitted and converted into a Tem ­\nperance Hall for the benefit of his parishioners. The \nworking tnen themselves were given a free band in mak­\ning out the programme of their first concert, and the· \ninnane and unnational thing that we have been refer­\ning to was the result. More than one member of the \nCommittee attempted to hav.e national songs introduced, \nbut to no purpose. The performers, all, we understand, \n\"patriots \" of the greenest type, were more concerned \nabout showing off their powers as vocalists in nigger and \nEnglish lyrics than singing even Anglo-Irish songs like \n\"The Wearing o' the Green,\" \"Who fears to speak of \n'98,\" or even Moore's melodies. But as persons \"ob­\nnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" what business is it of ours? \nSome members of the Executive of the Gaelic League \nshould look aHer these niggers of Clonmel. \nWe have received a report of the annual meeting of \nthe Duhallow C'oisde C'eanntair which was held recently \na,t Boherbee. Father P'. O'Regan, C.O., Vice-President, \nwas in the chair. The Secretary's report was as \nfollows :-The C'oiscle was established at a meeting held \nin Kanturk, on March 25th, 190-4, and bas been, there­\nfore, something more than twelve months in existence. \nDuring that time eight meetings have been held and \ntwenty-five resolutions passed, and this represents the \nsum total of the work .of your body. When the Coi~de \nwas established all the six branches of which it consists \nwere conducting Irish classes; but owing to the want of \na competent teacher among their members, no classes \nwere conducted in two of these branches during last \nsession. It will, therefore, be seen that the language \nis in a worse condition in Duhallow at present than it \nwas twelve months ago. vVere it not for the a.ction, or \nrather inaction, of your Coiscle and of the Coiscle \nGnotlw, these two branches would probably have \nmanaged to have classes somehow. As early \nas M'ay last, the question of appointing a \ntravelling teacher for the Coisde C'ecmntair area was \nunder consideration, but was postponed to \nOctober. vVlien the matter was brought on again at \ntlie October meeting, the majority of the delegates re­\nfused to take any action-on it, and would not even ask \nthe C'oiscle Gnotlui for a subsidy towards paying a teacher \nfor the branches that had none. The Secretary of one \nof the branches affected, seeing that no help was to be \nexpected from yom body, explained to the Goisde Gnotha \nthat his branch would fall through unless they got \nsome aid from the Central body to help them to pay \nthe salary of a teacher.

A public \nmeeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce with a \nview to promoting this Munster and Connacht industrial \n- enterprise. The meeting was a very representative one. \nFather J. M. Cl·egan, Adm ., to whose energy is to be \ncredited the St. Itas' Shirt Factory of Limerick, E. Cole \n~elson, James Flynn, City High Sheriff; G. Spillane, \nAlderman S. O'Mara, F. 0. Cle.eve, J.P.; R. Gibson, \nSir Charles Barrington, M. O'Gallaghan, Gerald Good­\nbody, T. Geary, E.. J. Long, M. D. Shaw, David Tid­\nmarsh, J . S. Gaffney, Solr.; J. O'Grady Delmege, D .L. ; \nRev. John Lee, C.C .. ; W. F. M'Namara--these various \nclasses of men were amongst those present, and their \nnames indicate the broad and representative basis upon \nwhich the proposed exhibition in July of next year is \nto be carried out. \nMr. T. A. Ferguson proposed \"that an Industrial \nExhibition be held in Limerick, opening the first week \nin July, 1906, to be called 'The Munster and Connacht \nIndustrial Exhibition.\" In supporting this resolution \nMr. James S. Gaffney, Solr., in the course of his re­\nmarks as reported in the ~/Jfunster 1Yews, said:-\" It was \na great pity that they, Limerick people, and Irish \npeople as a whole, especially in the South of Ireland, \nshould not rely sufficiently on themselves, and show that \nreliance by buying where they could goods made in Ire­\nland that were as good and cheap as goods made else­\nwhere (hear, hear). He_ had 3:dopted the practice in his \nown household of buymg Irish-manufactured goods. \nThe crux was, would things be got as good and as cheap \nin Ireland as elsewhere, and in that relation he had seen \na most interesting corresp01idence in a newspaper with \nsome of the views of which many people did not agree­\nhe meant the Dublin LEADER, which had done au enor­\nmous amount of good for the manufacturers of Ireland \n(hear, bear)-a correspondence a~ to _whether people \nshould buy Irish goods even at prices higher than those \npaid for the foreign goods, and he saw that the vas~ ma­\njority, of the manufacturers of Ireland were unammous \nin saying that they did not want any patronage on t~e \ngrouud that they were Irish mauufactul'Crs-they chcl \nnot want anybody to buy goods from them excep~ they \nwere as good and as cheap as goods manufactured many \npart of the world (hear, hear). If they put that forward \nin supporting this Exhibition, it would be a success.\" \nA Committee consisting of the E ,xecutive of the Lime­\nrick Industrial Association and the following-with \npower to adcl to their numbers--were appointed to carry \nout the arrangements for the. Munster and Connacht \nExhibition of 1906 :-Sir Thomas Cleave, Messrs. J. E. \nGoodbody, Archibald Murray, James Quin, Samu 'el Lee, \nWilliam Lloyd, David Tidmarsh, John Egan, A. Bar­\nnett, W. L. Stokes, P. E. Bourke together with the \nManagers of the five Banks in the city. \nThere was a \" Grand Christy Minstrel \" entertain­\nment and· concert at St. lVfary's Temperance Hall, Irish­\ntown, Glomnel. A programme of the great event is \nbefore us. The strenuous, manly and self-respecting \nmajority at a recent meeting of the Executive of the \nGaelic League in Dublin should look after the Olonmel \nniggers. 1'hey had no Irish vocal items, nay,, even \nmore, they had no Anglo-Irish vocal item at their enter­\ntainment at St. Mary's Temperance Hall, Irishtown, \nOlonmel, and yet no \"unauthorised persons\" even \n·\" held up\" Bones I • One of the niggers sang \"Looking \nfor a Coon like me.\" vVho was looking for him 7 As \nwe are persons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" perhaps \nwe have no right to intrude our enquiries into such mat­\nters. Why should we ask questions of Coons if we may \nnot ask a question of the Central Body of the Gaelic \nLeague? There are possibly \" unauthorised \" Coons \nas well as \" unauthorised\" Gaelic L~aguers I And if the \nGaelic League authorities are above criticism, why \nshould not the Coons, also, be exempt 7 Very Rev. \nCanon Flavin, P .P., au Irish speaker, is Director of the \nT em perance Sodality, but Canon Flavin is not respon­\nsible for this un-Irisb programme. We are informed \nthat Canon Flavin, with his own money acquired two \nhouses (one of them a drunkery, the licence of which he \nextinguished). These two houses he reconstructed, ex­\ntended, furnished, fitted and converted into a Tem ­\nperance Hall for the benefit of his parishioners. The \nworking tnen themselves were given a free band in mak­\ning out the programme of their first concert, and the· \ninnane and unnational thing that we have been refer­\ning to was the result. More than one member of the \nCommittee attempted to hav.e national songs introduced, \nbut to no purpose. The performers, all, we understand, \n\"patriots \" of the greenest type, were more concerned \nabout showing off their powers as vocalists in nigger and \nEnglish lyrics than singing even Anglo-Irish songs like \n\"The Wearing o' the Green,\" \"Who fears to speak of \n'98,\" or even Moore's melodies. But as persons \"ob­\nnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" what business is it of ours? \nSome members of the Executive of the Gaelic League \nshould look aHer these niggers of Clonmel. \nWe have received a report of the annual meeting of \nthe Duhallow C'oisde C'eanntair which was held recently \na,t Boherbee. Father P'. O'Regan, C.O., Vice-President, \nwas in the chair. The Secretary's report was as \nfollows :-The C'oiscle was established at a meeting held \nin Kanturk, on March 25th, 190-4, and bas been, there­\nfore, something more than twelve months in existence. \nDuring that time eight meetings have been held and \ntwenty-five resolutions passed, and this represents the \nsum total of the work .of your body. When the Coi~de \nwas established all the six branches of which it consists \nwere conducting Irish classes; but owing to the want of \na competent teacher among their members, no classes \nwere conducted in two of these branches during last \nsession. It will, therefore, be seen that the language \nis in a worse condition in Duhallow at present than it \nwas twelve months ago. vVere it not for the a.ction, or \nrather inaction, of your Coiscle and of the Coiscle \nGnotlw, these two branches would probably have \nmanaged to have classes somehow. As early \nas M'ay last, the question of appointing a \ntravelling teacher for the Coisde C'ecmntair area was \nunder consideration, but was postponed to \nOctober. vVlien the matter was brought on again at \ntlie October meeting, the majority of the delegates re­\nfused to take any action-on it, and would not even ask \nthe C'oiscle Gnotlui for a subsidy towards paying a teacher \nfor the branches that had none. The Secretary of one \nof the branches affected, seeing that no help was to be \nexpected from yom body, explained to the Goisde Gnotha \nthat his branch would fall through unless they got \nsome aid from the Central body to help them to pay \nthe salary of a teacher.

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

All \nthings considered, I regret to say that, in my opinion, if \nthe Irish tongue is to be saved in Duhallow , it will not \nbe through the means which your body bas adopted dur-\ning the past year.\" . . \nWe have received a copy of the programme of the \nforthcoming Fei·s to be held on the 25th and 26th July, \nat Strokestown b e 1L -<.\\tt- rM mb111L L') Co. Roscommon. \nThe President is the Very Rev. Canon Gately P .P ., \nV.F., and the Vice-President Rev . M. Brennan , C.C. \nThe Strokestown branch is a new one, and it is being \nworked with great vigour. In connection with the \nFeis an Industrial Exhibition will be held. \nWe have received St. Golu mba ., the bilingual annual\" \nissued· by the League of St. Columba, Maynooth Col­\nlege. It is published at one shilling net, by Messrs. \nM. H. Gill and Son, Ltd. The object of the League of \nSt. Columba is to foster in the students a due appre­\nciation of the val-µe in the cause of Religion, and of the \nconsequent claims upon the attention of Ecclesiastics, \nof stuclies--(a) In National Lite.rature and Language ; \n(b) In Na~ional History, especially Ecclesiastical; (c) In \nIrish Hagiology, Archreology, Social Manners ; and \nCustoms; and to encourage amongst its members the \ncultivation of these various departments, in order that \nthey may be more zealous and better qualified to labour \nin extending and controlling move:gients connected with \nthose objects, and so perpetuate the truly Religious and \nCatholic Nationality represented .by and identifi~d with \nthem. The articles, poems, etc., in the Irish language \nwhich appear in the volume, cover close on forty pages \nin this bulky annual of some 110 pages of reading \nmatter. Rev . W. O'Kennedy writes on the need of a \nreligious literature in the Irish Language. We note \nthat a book of Irish sermons copied from the MSS. in. \nthe library of Maynooth College, and edited by the \nstudents themselves for the Columban League, will be \nissued next month. The contents of St. Colmnba for \n1905 are very varied, and those responsible are to be \ncongratulated on the• interesting magazine that they \nhave turned out. \nThe students of Newbridge College have not lost \ntheir cunning as wielders of the .C ~\\min. During the: \nEaster holidays a hurling team of Past Students met · \n·the hurling team of the boys _now studying in the· \nCollege. The match was played in the College grounds, \nand resulted in a decisive victory for the home team. \nHappily, quite a net-work of Industrial Development \nAssociations ar.e being established in the country .. \nWaterford Oity has now added one to :the total. At a \nmeetina on Monday last, over ·which his lordship, Dr. \nSheeha':i presided, the Waterford Industrial Develop­\nment Association was formally established. The natural \nposition of Waterford marks it out as a place that \nshould be a centre of considerable industrial activity. \nThe Association was established under most favourable \nauspices, and with such a prominent al?-d able_ business \nman as Mr. James J. Phelan-as Pres1de1ft, it should \ndevelop rapidly along the verb \" to do \" direction. \nIrish industry is largely represented at the All Ire-• \nland T emperance Bazaar now proceeding at Hallsbridge. \nIn addition to the Irish industries stall, which is ex­\nclusively devoted to Irish Manufactures, many other \nstalls have a prominent display of home-made goods. \nThe wide constituency to which the Bazaar appeals has \nenabled the raffling system to be eliminated, and_ as \narticles of all kinds m ay be purchased at a normal pnce, \nthe bazaar is in reality a great market. At the Banba \nHall Mi ss S. Varian's Dram atic Sketch \"A Room with \na Story,\" will be performed twice each evening at 8 \nand 9 o'clock. H alf-hour Irish concerts and dances \nwill be given every evening from 8 p.m. in Tara's Hall. \nWhen the Dublin people and the visitors to Dublin \nhave taken all the enjoyment possible out of the Tem ­\nperance Bazaar this week , they will have the F eis Ceo·il \nto look forward to next w eek . The forthcoming F_ eis \nGeoil will be the ninth of these anual functions. Public \ncompetition in all branches of music, a concert lecture, \nand three evening concerts make up the programm~ . \nOn Monday evening next, the concert lecture at the \nAntient C oncert R ooms will be delivered by Mrs. C. \nMilligan Fox, on \" The Ev olution of Irish Folk Song .\" \nThis concert lecture should draw a popular as well as a \nmusical audience. ~re hope that the concerts and even­\ning comp etitions a~ the R oyal Univ ersity Buildings, \nand the clay competitions at the Antient Concert Rooms \nwill all be attended by very large audiences. No doubt \na large numb er of the visitors whom the bazaar of this \nweek has drawn to Dublin will remain over for the • \nF e·is. G eoil, so that, as far as audiences are concerned, \nthe festival this year ought to -be the most successful \nyet held. \nWe see by a newspaper report that the recent Dublin \nFeis was rather a failure. Vle can offer no personal \nopinion on the matter as we were not present. Being \npersons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" it was reasonable \nperhaps that we received no tickets for the function. \nThe Dublin Fe is was advertised in the \"confrere\" that \nclapped the criminal street blackguards on the back ; \nthe advertising pages of the LEADER, a paper run by \na person \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" were very \nnaturally not laid under contribution. It is evident \ntha~ wh atever particular department or body had the \nmanagement of the Fe is, that they, in their wisdom, \nthought it well to keep the Feis clear of anything con­\nnected with a person \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland.\" \nManaged with such foresight, wisdom and tact, the F r.is \nought to have been a great success. \nIn the course of some Language notes in the lnd.even­\nclent we read:-\" The Dublin Fe is is over. Satisfactory \nin a great many ways, it nevertheless showed that the \nIrish Language Movement might be a great deal stronger \nand a great deal more vigorous than it is in Dublin. \nSome two hundred persons paid for admission to the \ncompetitions on Saturday, and about the same number, \nroughly, paid for admission to Saturday night's con­\ncert. This is miserable for a city that can set thirty \nthousand people marching for the language ideal on \nIrish Language Sunday.\" Perhaps many people of the \n\" obnoxious to Irish Ireland \" class did not go. Some \npeaceful citizens may even foolishly have dreaded that \ngangs of \"unauthorised persons\" might be lurki~g \nround corners. The unfortunate failure of the Dubhn \nFeis ought to give ·some people pause. \nWe quote the following from the notes on the Gaelic \nLeague in the Weekly Freeman:-\" If we were to esti-",

Neither was there' an \n1Eridheacht, Sgoruidheacht, Cuirm Oeoil, or enter­\ntainment of any kind for the popularisation of the \nlanguage held under the auspices of your Go u de. All \nthings considered, I regret to say that, in my opinion, if \nthe Irish tongue is to be saved in Duhallow , it will not \nbe through the means which your body bas adopted dur-\ning the past year.\" . . \nWe have received a copy of the programme of the \nforthcoming Fei·s to be held on the 25th and 26th July, \nat Strokestown b e 1L -<.\\tt- rM mb111L L') Co. Roscommon. \nThe President is the Very Rev. Canon Gately P .P ., \nV.F., and the Vice-President Rev . M.

In connection with the \nFeis an Industrial Exhibition will be held. \nWe have received St. Golu mba ., the bilingual annual\" \nissued· by the League of St. Columba, Maynooth Col­\nlege. It is published at one shilling net, by Messrs. \nM. H. Gill and Son, Ltd. The object of the League of \nSt. Columba is to foster in the students a due appre­\nciation of the val-µe in the cause of Religion, and of the \nconsequent claims upon the attention of Ecclesiastics, \nof stuclies--(a) In National Lite.rature and Language ; \n(b) In Na~ional History, especially Ecclesiastical; (c) In \nIrish Hagiology, Archreology, Social Manners ; and \nCustoms; and to encourage amongst its members the \ncultivation of these various departments, in order that \nthey may be more zealous and better qualified to labour \nin extending and controlling move:gients connected with \nthose objects, and so perpetuate the truly Religious and \nCatholic Nationality represented .by and identifi~d with \nthem. The articles, poems, etc., in the Irish language \nwhich appear in the volume, cover close on forty pages \nin this bulky annual of some 110 pages of reading \nmatter. Rev . W. O'Kennedy writes on the need of a \nreligious literature in the Irish Language. We note \nthat a book of Irish sermons copied from the MSS. in. \nthe library of Maynooth College, and edited by the \nstudents themselves for the Columban League, will be \nissued next month. The contents of St. Colmnba for \n1905 are very varied, and those responsible are to be \ncongratulated on the• interesting magazine that they \nhave turned out. \nThe students of Newbridge College have not lost \ntheir cunning as wielders of the .C ~\\min. During the: \nEaster holidays a hurling team of Past Students met · \n·the hurling team of the boys _now studying in the· \nCollege. The match was played in the College grounds, \nand resulted in a decisive victory for the home team. \nHappily, quite a net-work of Industrial Development \nAssociations ar.e being established in the country .. \nWaterford Oity has now added one to :the total. At a \nmeetina on Monday last, over ·which his lordship, Dr. \nSheeha':i presided, the Waterford Industrial Develop­\nment Association was formally established. The natural \nposition of Waterford marks it out as a place that \nshould be a centre of considerable industrial activity. \nThe Association was established under most favourable \nauspices, and with such a prominent al?-d able_ business \nman as Mr. James J. Phelan-as Pres1de1ft, it should \ndevelop rapidly along the verb \" to do \" direction. \nIrish industry is largely represented at the All Ire-• \nland T emperance Bazaar now proceeding at Hallsbridge. \nIn addition to the Irish industries stall, which is ex­\nclusively devoted to Irish Manufactures, many other \nstalls have a prominent display of home-made goods. \nThe wide constituency to which the Bazaar appeals has \nenabled the raffling system to be eliminated, and_ as \narticles of all kinds m ay be purchased at a normal pnce, \nthe bazaar is in reality a great market. At the Banba \nHall Mi ss S. Varian's Dram atic Sketch \"A Room with \na Story,\" will be performed twice each evening at 8 \nand 9 o'clock. H alf-hour Irish concerts and dances \nwill be given every evening from 8 p.m. in Tara's Hall. \nWhen the Dublin people and the visitors to Dublin \nhave taken all the enjoyment possible out of the Tem ­\nperance Bazaar this week , they will have the F eis Ceo·il \nto look forward to next w eek . The forthcoming F_ eis \nGeoil will be the ninth of these anual functions. Public \ncompetition in all branches of music, a concert lecture, \nand three evening concerts make up the programm~ . \nOn Monday evening next, the concert lecture at the \nAntient C oncert R ooms will be delivered by Mrs. C. \nMilligan Fox, on \" The Ev olution of Irish Folk Song .\" \nThis concert lecture should draw a popular as well as a \nmusical audience. ~re hope that the concerts and even­\ning comp etitions a~ the R oyal Univ ersity Buildings, \nand the clay competitions at the Antient Concert Rooms \nwill all be attended by very large audiences. No doubt \na large numb er of the visitors whom the bazaar of this \nweek has drawn to Dublin will remain over for the • \nF e·is. G eoil, so that, as far as audiences are concerned, \nthe festival this year ought to -be the most successful \nyet held. \nWe see by a newspaper report that the recent Dublin \nFeis was rather a failure. Vle can offer no personal \nopinion on the matter as we were not present. Being \npersons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" it was reasonable \nperhaps that we received no tickets for the function. \nThe Dublin Fe is was advertised in the \"confrere\" that \nclapped the criminal street blackguards on the back ; \nthe advertising pages of the LEADER, a paper run by \na person \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" were very \nnaturally not laid under contribution. It is evident \ntha~ wh atever particular department or body had the \nmanagement of the Fe is, that they, in their wisdom, \nthought it well to keep the Feis clear of anything con­\nnected with a person \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland.\" \nManaged with such foresight, wisdom and tact, the F r.is \nought to have been a great success. \nIn the course of some Language notes in the lnd.even­\nclent we read:-\" The Dublin Fe is is over. Satisfactory \nin a great many ways, it nevertheless showed that the \nIrish Language Movement might be a great deal stronger \nand a great deal more vigorous than it is in Dublin. \nSome two hundred persons paid for admission to the \ncompetitions on Saturday, and about the same number, \nroughly, paid for admission to Saturday night's con­\ncert. This is miserable for a city that can set thirty \nthousand people marching for the language ideal on \nIrish Language Sunday.\" Perhaps many people of the \n\" obnoxious to Irish Ireland \" class did not go. Some \npeaceful citizens may even foolishly have dreaded that \ngangs of \"unauthorised persons\" might be lurki~g \nround corners. The unfortunate failure of the Dubhn \nFeis ought to give ·some people pause. \nWe quote the following from the notes on the Gaelic \nLeague in the Weekly Freeman:-\" If we were to esti-",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter.

S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

We have increased out\nteams from six to thirteen. We have also established the Munster\nCollege Football League, Munster College Hurling League, East\nCork Hurling League, North Cork Football League, North Cork\nHurling League, Cork City Saturday Hurling League. We are\nendeavouring to establish similar organizations in other Parlia-\nmentary Divisions. We, too, went on a big Eastern Tour to\nDundalk and Dublin, taking 40 players and participating in four\nmatches in two days (two in Dundalk and two in Dublin). Assisted\n_ by our Hurlers of East and South-east Cork Leagues, we also\nsent two teams to Kilkenny and played against representatives\n_ of the ‘‘ Marble City.”",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

          "raw_text": "MAY 20. 1905. THE LEADER. 197 \nmate the str_ength of •the movement in Dublin city and \ncounty by the Feis held in the. Rotunda on Saturday, \nwe sho_uld be compelled to admit that the influence of \nthe League is dimini~hiug instead qf increasing in and \naround the metropol~s. It ~as a very poor Feis, no \nmatter from what pomt of view we regard it. In the \nfirst place, the attendance of the general public was \n• very small, and this remark applies equally to the day \nproceedings and to the .Cuirm Ceoil in the evening. \nApart from the competitors and officials there were \nscarcely a hundred people present at the competitions, \nand I have never seen a smaller gathering at a Ouirm \nCeoil in the Round Room, except, perhaps, the audience \nthat used to attend the performances of the Oireachtas \nChoir. This is unsatisfactory, for it cannot fail to leave \nthe committee with a considerable balance to the wrong \nside when the accounts of the Feis are closed.\" \nHappily for himself these notes are written by \"An Lcv­\nrecha:1rn,\" and we all know that a Levrechawn is not the \neasiest thing in the world to catch. In the days of our \nextrelI!e youth we made many a fruitless search in the \nearly hours of the morning for a Levrecha,11,n. The \nstreet blackguards of the Gaelic League who remain \nundenounced by the E -xecutive will have their work cut \nout for them if they wish to \" hold up \" a Leprecha.itn \nfor his critical note. Catch your Lcvrecliaim before \nyou h~ld him up. \n'\\Ve received-no invitation to the P e1·s, and so cannot \n-speak of it from personal observation. In view of the \nnotes we have quoted from the lndevenclent and from \nthe Weekly Freeman, it is perhaps only fair to g_ive t~e \nfollowing from the official organ : -\" The D~bhn F~is \nproves amongst other t~ings that the ~eague m Dubhn \nis very much alive,-ahve not _merely m the se~1se that \nit ca-n astonish the public by a huge demonstration once \na year, but in the sense tha~ it is working all the \nwhile, that it is actually producmg spea~ers_ and readers \nand writers of the language.\" As the JUmor reporters \nsay, comment is· needless. The organ that tapped t~e \ncriminal street blackguards on the. back and t~at is \nlikewise a \"confrere \" of the official organ, said: -\n\" No one who attended the Dublin Feis last Sat~tr?ay \ncould fail to be struck with the improvement exh~bited \n• in practically all the competitions.'' An~ agam : -\n\" The concert at night was one of th~ best Insh concerts \nrecently given in Dublin. The audience was large, ~ut \nit should have been even larger.\" Our re'.1-ders, with­\nout any suggestion from us, can make then· own com­\nments. The fight before the League three _months ago \nwas enough to try the strongest !1eart ; smce ~he~ a \nweak Executive has in a sense alhed the Orga~usat~on \nwith street blackguardism, and the consequ~ut situation \nis anything but encouraging. '!'he ~xecutiv~ has _been \ntried and has been found wantrng ; 1t remams for the \n.6.r-o fe1r to take the League out of the gutter. \nvVe have received cheque for £3 for the ~anguage \nFund from Father Fuller, P.P., of ~ 'allybumon, Co. \nK .

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

Such in­\nterests as language, law s, m aimers, national ideals.w ere \ninvolved in it. Bu t the inhabitants of the P ale only \nwe re affected ; for, even in the reign of H enry V III., \nt.lie laws ma de by the P arliam ent of the P ale w ere not \ncbeyed twenty miles outside Dublin. Bu t the year \n1537 m arks the beginning of a new epoch in the rela­\ntions between E ngland and Ireland. Th e King claimed \nspiritual as w ell as political supremacy , and the attempt \nto make the Irish substitu te his auU 1ority for the spiri­\ntual supremacy of the P ope brought a new elem ent into \nthe education question. It henceforth became a politico­\nreligious question, and it ha.s remained so to this day . \nTh e object, avowe d or concealed, of every system of \neducation w hich has been devised for the Irish people \neven since has been the Ang licisation of their counti·y. \n• The introduction of the religious eleme nt has not \nchanged the ultimate p urpose. It has been sought to \nP rotestantise them, not so mu ch to save their souls, as \nto A nglicise them . T he spiritual authority assumed \nbY, He nry ~yas w rapped up in his royal authority, as the \nlesser -is\",con.tained in the greater, or as the mea ns is \ndirected to the end . H o:,vever the name may be dis­\nowne d, it is not easy to see how a religion can be na­\ntionalised w ithout being E rastian . Ha d the attempt s \nto P rotestantise the Irish Catholics been w holly or \nma inly successful, Ireland should no longer be a nation, \nbut a province, . w ith no . mo re national individuality \nthan York shire. The Irish in using one and the sam e \nwo rcl., s ,,r,\\11,,(', to express Protestant and En glishman, \ninterpret the philosophy of their history more truly and \nthoroughly than m ost of them have thought . \nIf w e except wha tever education Irish Ca tholics ac­\nquired by stealth, from tha.t time to 1782 the stern alter­\nnative for them w as, their faith without education, or \neducation w ithout their faith. An Act passed in 1665, \nduring the reign of Charles II., fixed that alternative \nby law ; and more stringently still, an Act passed iu \n1 696 during the reign of \\V illiam III., and another \npassed in 1703 under Queen Anne. During all the \nI.8th century the law did not suppose a C atholic to re­\nceive au education, siuce, as w as declared officia.lly from \ntho bench by au Irish judge in 1758, the \"law did not \nsuppose a Papist to exist in the Kingdom , nor could \nthey breathe without _the connivance of government.'' \nCatholic education became possible in 1782, but under \ncertain difficult and dangerous conditions. In 1793 the \nfirst Relief Act came. The clouds of persecution then \nbegan to break, and Ca,tholics were allowed the privilege \nof having their own private schools at their own ex­\npense; they were also permitted to graduate in Trinity \nCollege, but without the privilege of its prizes or emolu­\nments. Since that time several systems of education \nhave been framed for them . But they have not been \nallowed to frame any public system for themselves, and \nthey justly disown all responsibility for eclucational1 \nshortcomings and failures. They rightly say; let those, \nwho have framed those systems which have hitherto been : \ntried, presuming to understand better than ourselves \nwhat system sttits us best, be_ar the discredit of failure \n• I \nl",

Such in­\nterests as language, law s, m aimers, national ideals.w ere \ninvolved in it. Bu t the inhabitants of the P ale only \nwe re affected ; for, even in the reign of H enry V III., \nt.lie laws ma de by the P arliam ent of the P ale w ere not \ncbeyed twenty miles outside Dublin. Bu t the year \n1537 m arks the beginning of a new epoch in the rela­\ntions between E ngland and Ireland. Th e King claimed \nspiritual as w ell as political supremacy , and the attempt \nto make the Irish substitu te his auU 1ority for the spiri­\ntual supremacy of the P ope brought a new elem ent into \nthe education question. It henceforth became a politico­\nreligious question, and it ha.s remained so to this day . \nTh e object, avowe d or concealed, of every system of \neducation w hich has been devised for the Irish people \neven since has been the Ang licisation of their counti·y. \n• The introduction of the religious eleme nt has not \nchanged the ultimate p urpose. It has been sought to \nP rotestantise them, not so mu ch to save their souls, as \nto A nglicise them . T he spiritual authority assumed \nbY, He nry ~yas w rapped up in his royal authority, as the \nlesser -is\",con.tained in the greater, or as the mea ns is \ndirected to the end . H o:,vever the name may be dis­\nowne d, it is not easy to see how a religion can be na­\ntionalised w ithout being E rastian . Ha d the attempt s \nto P rotestantise the Irish Catholics been w holly or \nma inly successful, Ireland should no longer be a nation, \nbut a province, . w ith no . mo re national individuality \nthan York shire. The Irish in using one and the sam e \nwo rcl., s ,,r,\\11,,(', to express Protestant and En glishman, \ninterpret the philosophy of their history more truly and \nthoroughly than m ost of them have thought . \nIf w e except wha tever education Irish Ca tholics ac­\nquired by stealth, from tha.t time to 1782 the stern alter­\nnative for them w as, their faith without education, or \neducation w ithout their faith. An Act passed in 1665, \nduring the reign of Charles II., fixed that alternative \nby law ; and more stringently still, an Act passed iu \n1 696 during the reign of \\V illiam III., and another \npassed in 1703 under Queen Anne. During all the \nI.8th century the law did not suppose a C atholic to re­\nceive au education, siuce, as w as declared officia.lly from \ntho bench by au Irish judge in 1758, the \"law did not \nsuppose a Papist to exist in the Kingdom , nor could \nthey breathe without _the connivance of government.'' \nCatholic education became possible in 1782, but under \ncertain difficult and dangerous conditions. In 1793 the \nfirst Relief Act came. The clouds of persecution then \nbegan to break, and Ca,tholics were allowed the privilege \nof having their own private schools at their own ex­\npense; they were also permitted to graduate in Trinity \nCollege, but without the privilege of its prizes or emolu­\nments. Since that time several systems of education \nhave been framed for them . But they have not been \nallowed to frame any public system for themselves, and \nthey justly disown all responsibility for eclucational1 \nshortcomings and failures. They rightly say; let those, \nwho have framed those systems which have hitherto been : \ntried, presuming to understand better than ourselves \nwhat system sttits us best, be_ar the discredit of failure \n• I \nl",

Such in­\nterests as language, law s, m aimers, national ideals.w ere \ninvolved in it. Bu t the inhabitants of the P ale only \nwe re affected ; for, even in the reign of H enry V III., \nt.lie laws ma de by the P arliam ent of the P ale w ere not \ncbeyed twenty miles outside Dublin. Bu t the year \n1537 m arks the beginning of a new epoch in the rela­\ntions between E ngland and Ireland. Th e King claimed \nspiritual as w ell as political supremacy , and the attempt \nto make the Irish substitu te his auU 1ority for the spiri­\ntual supremacy of the P ope brought a new elem ent into \nthe education question. It henceforth became a politico­\nreligious question, and it ha.s remained so to this day . \nTh e object, avowe d or concealed, of every system of \neducation w hich has been devised for the Irish people \neven since has been the Ang licisation of their counti·y. \n• The introduction of the religious eleme nt has not \nchanged the ultimate p urpose. It has been sought to \nP rotestantise them, not so mu ch to save their souls, as \nto A nglicise them . T he spiritual authority assumed \nbY, He nry ~yas w rapped up in his royal authority, as the \nlesser -is\",con.tained in the greater, or as the mea ns is \ndirected to the end . H o:,vever the name may be dis­\nowne d, it is not easy to see how a religion can be na­\ntionalised w ithout being E rastian . Ha d the attempt s \nto P rotestantise the Irish Catholics been w holly or \nma inly successful, Ireland should no longer be a nation, \nbut a province, . w ith no . mo re national individuality \nthan York shire. The Irish in using one and the sam e \nwo rcl., s ,,r,\\11,,(', to express Protestant and En glishman, \ninterpret the philosophy of their history more truly and \nthoroughly than m ost of them have thought . \nIf w e except wha tever education Irish Ca tholics ac­\nquired by stealth, from tha.t time to 1782 the stern alter­\nnative for them w as, their faith without education, or \neducation w ithout their faith. An Act passed in 1665, \nduring the reign of Charles II., fixed that alternative \nby law ; and more stringently still, an Act passed iu \n1 696 during the reign of \\V illiam III., and another \npassed in 1703 under Queen Anne. During all the \nI.8th century the law did not suppose a C atholic to re­\nceive au education, siuce, as w as declared officia.lly from \ntho bench by au Irish judge in 1758, the \"law did not \nsuppose a Papist to exist in the Kingdom , nor could \nthey breathe without _the connivance of government.'' \nCatholic education became possible in 1782, but under \ncertain difficult and dangerous conditions. In 1793 the \nfirst Relief Act came. The clouds of persecution then \nbegan to break, and Ca,tholics were allowed the privilege \nof having their own private schools at their own ex­\npense; they were also permitted to graduate in Trinity \nCollege, but without the privilege of its prizes or emolu­\nments. Since that time several systems of education \nhave been framed for them . But they have not been \nallowed to frame any public system for themselves, and \nthey justly disown all responsibility for eclucational1 \nshortcomings and failures. They rightly say; let those, \nwho have framed those systems which have hitherto been : \ntried, presuming to understand better than ourselves \nwhat system sttits us best, be_ar the discredit of failure \n• I \nl",

Such in­\nterests as language, law s, m aimers, national ideals.w ere \ninvolved in it. Bu t the inhabitants of the P ale only \nwe re affected ; for, even in the reign of H enry V III., \nt.lie laws ma de by the P arliam ent of the P ale w ere not \ncbeyed twenty miles outside Dublin. Bu t the year \n1537 m arks the beginning of a new epoch in the rela­\ntions between E ngland and Ireland. Th e King claimed \nspiritual as w ell as political supremacy , and the attempt \nto make the Irish substitu te his auU 1ority for the spiri­\ntual supremacy of the P ope brought a new elem ent into \nthe education question. It henceforth became a politico­\nreligious question, and it ha.s remained so to this day . \nTh e object, avowe d or concealed, of every system of \neducation w hich has been devised for the Irish people \neven since has been the Ang licisation of their counti·y. \n• The introduction of the religious eleme nt has not \nchanged the ultimate p urpose. It has been sought to \nP rotestantise them, not so mu ch to save their souls, as \nto A nglicise them . T he spiritual authority assumed \nbY, He nry ~yas w rapped up in his royal authority, as the \nlesser -is\",con.tained in the greater, or as the mea ns is \ndirected to the end . H o:,vever the name may be dis­\nowne d, it is not easy to see how a religion can be na­\ntionalised w ithout being E rastian . Ha d the attempt s \nto P rotestantise the Irish Catholics been w holly or \nma inly successful, Ireland should no longer be a nation, \nbut a province, . w ith no . mo re national individuality \nthan York shire. The Irish in using one and the sam e \nwo rcl., s ,,r,\\11,,(', to express Protestant and En glishman, \ninterpret the philosophy of their history more truly and \nthoroughly than m ost of them have thought . \nIf w e except wha tever education Irish Ca tholics ac­\nquired by stealth, from tha.t time to 1782 the stern alter­\nnative for them w as, their faith without education, or \neducation w ithout their faith. An Act passed in 1665, \nduring the reign of Charles II., fixed that alternative \nby law ; and more stringently still, an Act passed iu \n1 696 during the reign of \\V illiam III., and another \npassed in 1703 under Queen Anne. During all the \nI.8th century the law did not suppose a C atholic to re­\nceive au education, siuce, as w as declared officia.lly from \ntho bench by au Irish judge in 1758, the \"law did not \nsuppose a Papist to exist in the Kingdom , nor could \nthey breathe without _the connivance of government.'' \nCatholic education became possible in 1782, but under \ncertain difficult and dangerous conditions. In 1793 the \nfirst Relief Act came. The clouds of persecution then \nbegan to break, and Ca,tholics were allowed the privilege \nof having their own private schools at their own ex­\npense; they were also permitted to graduate in Trinity \nCollege, but without the privilege of its prizes or emolu­\nments. Since that time several systems of education \nhave been framed for them . But they have not been \nallowed to frame any public system for themselves, and \nthey justly disown all responsibility for eclucational1 \nshortcomings and failures. They rightly say; let those, \nwho have framed those systems which have hitherto been : \ntried, presuming to understand better than ourselves \nwhat system sttits us best, be_ar the discredit of failure \n• I \nl",
