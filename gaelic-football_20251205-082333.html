With them his word and présence were more\npowerful in critical moments on the hurling and football field than all\nother influences combined. To be amongst them made him young again;\ntheir victories swelled his heart with boyish enthusiasm, but none of his\nselection ever felt more despondent than he did when fortune smiled\nthe other way. A fluent Gaelic speaker, he was a prominent figure at\nevery Aeridheacht; his local brass band, of which he felt so proud, was\nalways accorded an honoured place at all the great demonstrations of\nthe early Land League, but as a temperance reformer his good work was\nincalculable. The local Temperance Hall was his creation, and many\nhumorous tales are recorded of his efforts to capture the erring one.\nOn one occasion he happened on a party of three who, having forgotten\nthe pledge, retired to a private house and were revelling in a high time\nwhen the door opened and his reverence appeared. There was no\nescaping the pledge, and the defensive arguments drifted towards com-\npromise. No, he would not allow them two drinks, nor even one for\nthe morrow. The party had been imbibing “mulled stout” through the\nmedium of an old’ teapot commandeered for the occasion, and as a last\nresource one of them, pointing to the apparently harmless old pot near\nthe fire, asked indifferently; “‘ Would you let us drink what’s in the tea-\npot itself?” “Oh,” replied his reverence, mistaking its contents, “you\nmay drink all you like out of the teapot,” and after the pledge they did,\nand were found two days later worse than ever, by his reverence, carry-\ning out the letter of the pledge through the teapot. Father Casey\nbecame suspicious of “teapot” pledges after that. Having run down a\npledge breaker at another time, the latter astonished Father Casey by\nasking: “ Were you ever drunk, Father?” “No,” smilingly replied his\ncaptor, “why do you ask?” “Because,” he continued, “I know you\nweren't, for if you ever lived until the next morning you'd never think\nit necessary to preach another sermon on the ‘Cure of Drink.’”",

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound.

They \nseem _ to have no system of in~pection in the Depart­\nmen~at lea:;it, no competent mspection-to see that \nthe lect~r~rs and technical instructors are kept to theil' \nwork faithfully and according to their agreements. The \nle?turers and experts seem to be left to their own sweet \nwill. _While, of c~urs~, a~ expert or a specialist is not \nt? be mterfered with m his routine work , at the sam e \n. time some sort of supervision should be in force to see \n.t~_at du~ks and dra~es were . not made of an important \nt~ 1al. w hi?h at ~~e. time Pa,rhamen t was being moved to \ngive special facilities to, and which the Ohancellor of the \nExchequor, badgered and cornered by the Irish M em­\nbers, and some of the leading people in the tobacco \ntrade, at la.st . consented to give what practically \na~nounted to a big bounty to encourage the experiment. \n~t would al:'pear the experiment in that year was re­\nstricted _to a little over an acre, the place selected being \na plot m th~ ground of the Munst er Institute a few \nm~les outside Cork. The soil was admirable'. The \nIrish: plants were strong and healthy ones-better than \nthe imported French ones. The ground was heavily \n~anured, and the c~op gave an early promise of being a \nbig success. But it turned out an absolute failure. \nWhy was it not a success 1 Was it properly attended \nto?· Tobacco-growing requires almost the attention of \na _flower-gai·den. Was the crop even weeded 1 In short, \ndid ~he expert who had o_nly this small plot really attend \nto his duties 1 The Agncultu_ral Depa rtment t~ll us in \ntheir report for that year:- \" Much damage was done to \nthe crop by rooks.\" Sw-ely such an a·ccident could \nhave been prevented. Here was a crop raised artifi­\ncially: Some of the plants actually imported \nat great expense from France. Yet a small boy \nwith a pair of clappers, or an old man with a flint-lock \nmusket could not be employed at a shilling a day to pro­\ntect .such a valuable crop from the crows. Did it come \nto the knowledge of the Department that matters at the \nl\\funstet Institute farm-and we believe it did-were \nbe1ng sadly neglected? Surely this was a case of losing \n. the sheep for a pennyworth of tar. \n· Further, when the leaf-crop was gathered in, or as \nmqch of it as the French .expert chose to collect, no \neffort seems to have been made to give the crop a fair \nchance of being cured. AJ,, the Agricultural Depart­\nment report says:-\" In drying the crop_~n !),ttempt was \nmade to dispense with a costly house and heating appa­\nratus. A rough, wooden shed· was therefore er~cted -in \nthe field, and there the leaves were dried, ·and then they' \nwere removed to a barn in which a coke stove supplied \nthe necessary heat .. \" After such a rude attempt at cur-· \ning the plants much could not be expected. We might \nask, was the expert restricted in his attempts to cure the \nplants 'by having imperfect tools? 0i· did anyone see \nwh _at he was attempting·to do ? Or, and we ask the ques­\ntion. again, w.as the Department informed or aware of \n_ the negl!icted state of affairs? -.But let us quote the De-\n., pai;tment's repoi,t itself:-\" A special expert is required \n.to superintend the fermentation of tobacco, ancl, in­\nstead _of procuring an officer from abroad for this pur­\npose, the leaves were sent to Paris with the object of \nhaving them fermented in the Government factory \n• there. tr nfortunaiely considerable difficulty arose in \nhaving the tobacco transferred from the Custom House \non its arrival in France. Delays occuri-ed, and when \nthe. tobacco eventually arrived at the Government fac-• \ntory, it bad greatly deteriorated owing to the absorption \nof moisture.\" The fact really was, no attempt had been \nmade by the Department to obtain the free entry of the \nleaf with the French Custom House people, and the \nleaves lay exposed and sodden at Dieppe for some t]il-ee \nweeks bcfoi·e the necessary per~it was obtained. \n• \"BUY NAVAN BACON AND HA.MS. BEST ON \nTHE MARKET.\" \n\" Ask for it and see that you get it.\" \n\"Bold by a.II leading Purveyon.\" \nThe Agricultural Department's report ends here.- But \nthere is a sequel. They do not tell us what was the end \nof ~his costly experiment, the result of a four years' \ntri~l, and the product .of a highly-paid expert speci~lly \nbrought over from Paris. The tobacco leaves, we be­\nlieve, when they reached the Paris Government factory, \nwere in such a rotten condition owing to the delays in \ntransit, and the wretched way in which they were \npacked, that they had to be thro.wn out on the manure \nheap and burned. Such was the ending of this costly \nexperiment. Incompetence, neglect, and carelessness \nall round . \nNow, we do not wish to be too hard on the Technical \nDepartment ; but.if this is a sample of the work done by \nit, it is a sorry exhibition of carelessness, neglect, and \nindifference, not to mention wanton waste. of money \nwhich was-and is so-sadly wanted in other ways. -There \nshould be some system of inspection or, overlooking \nwhich would prevent such a fiasco as this. If it,had \nbeen the first or second year of the tobacco -experiment \nit might be condoned, but at the end of the fourth \nyear's trials, taking the most charitable view of the \nm atter, such incompetence and neglect deserve severe \ncensure on those who direct and control--or affect to do \nso-such matters. In my next article I shall deal with \nlast year's experiment and other m atters, which show \nthe Agricultural Department is taking a rather strange \nview of its rights and privileges in connection with \ntobacco culture and curing. \nR.H. 0. \nTHE YERDICT OF THE MANUFACTURI BS. \n'f HIS week we pu~lish a third batch of interesting \nletters from Insh m anufacturers concerning the \nas-good-and-as-cheap policy.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

That 'article which appeared 'in our issue of \nNovember 10th, 1900, was on Boots. We frnd, on \nreferring back to it, that our appr~ximate calculation, \nassuming that all the leather used m the boots had 'to \nbe imported-and as a matter of fact that was not, or is \nnot, so-was that about £800,000• a year would go to \nshoeing the population of Ireland. Our information \nat the time was t4at not one-tenth of that sum was \nkept in the country, or in other words, that £720,000 \nwas lost to it because Ireland did not shoe itself. • Since \nthen a considerable improvement has be~n effected .. \nWinstanley's is the largest boot factory in Ireland, and \nin our Christmas Number, December, 190·3, they an­\nnounced that they employed over 300 workers in their \nfactory, and found that number insufficient to execute \nall orders, and added, \" skilled labour urgently l·e­\nquired.\" The Lee B'oots, of Cork; Hearn and Cahill, \nof \\V'aterford; Williamson's, of Belfast, no doubt also \nconsiderably expanded their output; but in view of our \napproximate calculation four and a half years ago, that \neven assuming that Ireland imported all the leather \nused in the boots made-which she does n-ot, and the \ntanning industry is capable of great development--that \nthe country paid to foreign makers £720>,000 annually \non the head of ·boots, there is a great margin left to be \nworked upon. There is a good deal of picking on \n£720 ,000· a year, and notwithstanding the considerable \nadvance that has been made in the way of the Irish \nconsumers giving up playing the fool by supporting \nforeign boots when Irish boots were to be had as good \nand as cheap, there is still a great deal of work left for \nthe common-sense Irish boot-buyer to do. Every reader \nof the LEADER is a purchaser of boots, anc} we put it to \nthe intellect of each one of them that they should de­\nmand in the shops in .which they deal that they be \nenabled to sample Irish-made boots that are fighting \nin competition with foreign boots. If they find them \nright as regards quality and price, they should most un­\ndoubtedly give them the preference. If our· readers \nfind that the shops in. which they deal do not offer a \nfair opportunity to their customers to-sample and use \ntheir own judgment on the merits of Irish-made boots \nas against British and foreign boots, they ought, in fair­\nness to the industrial inte1:ests of the country, to \nspeak firmly to, and what is more, act firmly with, \nsuch shop-keepers. Irish boots are entitled ·to a fair. \nfield and no favour in the shops of Ireland th.at deal in \nboots, and our readers should see as far as they reason• \nably may do so, that they get it. The boot manufac­\nturers of Ireland have rio right to ask the public for as \nmuch as,~ brass farthing for nothing, but they are en­\ntit~~!!. to a preference from the Irish buying public on \ntheir merits. We put the case this way :-It is common \nsense that the w:hole_ country benefits by the prosperity .. \nof the boot-makmg mdustry; the common-sense public \nwho read the LEADER are not asked -to make any sacri­\nfice for the sake of the special boot-making interest, but \nthey are, as common-sense, thinking people, asked to \nsee that they do not make a sacrifice for the benefit of \nBritish and American boot manufactm·ers; they a.re \nasked _to see t~at Irish-made boots get a fair field. We \nrepudiate the idea that they are entitled to any favour \nbeyond that, other things being equal, Irish boots, as \na matt~r of common sense, should ·get the preference \nfrom Irish boot _wearers ... We say that·eyery Irish boot \nshop should be m a pos1t1on. to show its customers fair \nsamples of the products of the several Irish boot factories. • \n. • The boot factory of Mr. Michael Governey, of Oarlow, \n1s a r«:_c~nt grow~h of the Industrial Revival. Mr . \nGov~rney . (tradm~ as Corcoran and Co.) is \nan extensive mmeral . water manufacturer also \na _manufl!,ctur~r, or _brewer, of hop bitters'. We \nspe~t several mtere~tmg hours looking over both fac­\ntories. Many of his mineral water machines are the \ninve~tion of _an Irishman, almost needless to say, the \n• 1Jart1cular Inshman had to go over to Britain _with his \nI \nl",

MAY 6; 1905. \nTHE LEADER AND THE LEAGUE-. \nI \nT is puerile, if ·not worse, on the part of the \n. . majority of the Gaelic League Executive present \nat ~he late meeting, to deprecate controversy on the \nsubJect of the outrage on Procession Sunday, when they \n~ave themselves created a situation- very plainly put \n. 1n the first paragraph of your last issue- which is simply \nuntena.ble and cannot possibly be brooked by the more \nstrenuous ·and straightforward Revivalists in the pro­\nvinces. The Executive must tell us once for all and \nin unequivocal languaae whether th~y endorse o~· un­\nqu~lifi.edly • condemn, the outrage in questio~1. The \nEditor of the ~EADER is quite competent to fight his \nown corner agamst any honourable antagonist, but he \ncannot be expected to go about armed with a life pre­\nserver .or a revolver to defend himself against every \nblackguard, who, backed up by kindred spirits of the • \ncorner-boy -class, substitutes physical force for intel­\nlectual argument. \nI submit, therefore, that in the present juncture, there \nshould be a strong expression of opinion in condemna­\ntion of the outrage, and the unsatisfactory action ·,f \nthe Executive, from the numerous and influential body \nof Irish Irelanders throughout the country who look \nto the militant LEADER as the exnonent \n0f their views and the most efficient organ of \nthe great National Revival as distinguished from that \nbrnnch of it--the Language Movement . Vve are, all 0f \nus, deeply interested in the Langu age Movemen t, and \nhave given and taken hard knocks on its account; but \nwhen we wanted, through the medium of _the press, to \nfurther its interests-to encourage its friends or to pil-• \nlory its e.nemies-it w as never to the official organ but \nto the LEADER that we looked for a platform. \nWhen the. LEADER first saw the light, the Language \nMovement had not yet emerged from the Catacombs . \nI well remember I was passing through the metropolis \nabout the time. I had occasio·n to call on a distin­\nguished member of one of the great Regular Orders­\nhim~elf a well-known literary man, and now head of an \nimportant house abroad. He it was that directed my \nattention to the LEADER, the first number of which was \nthen on:· the eve of appearing. At the same time he \ninquired what progress, if any, the Gaelic League was \nma.king in my neighbourhood.

MAY 6; 1905. \nTHE LEADER AND THE LEAGUE-. \nI \nT is puerile, if ·not worse, on the part of the \n. . majority of the Gaelic League Executive present \nat ~he late meeting, to deprecate controversy on the \nsubJect of the outrage on Procession Sunday, when they \n~ave themselves created a situation- very plainly put \n. 1n the first paragraph of your last issue- which is simply \nuntena.ble and cannot possibly be brooked by the more \nstrenuous ·and straightforward Revivalists in the pro­\nvinces. The Executive must tell us once for all and \nin unequivocal languaae whether th~y endorse o~· un­\nqu~lifi.edly • condemn, the outrage in questio~1. The \nEditor of the ~EADER is quite competent to fight his \nown corner agamst any honourable antagonist, but he \ncannot be expected to go about armed with a life pre­\nserver .or a revolver to defend himself against every \nblackguard, who, backed up by kindred spirits of the • \ncorner-boy -class, substitutes physical force for intel­\nlectual argument. \nI submit, therefore, that in the present juncture, there \nshould be a strong expression of opinion in condemna­\ntion of the outrage, and the unsatisfactory action ·,f \nthe Executive, from the numerous and influential body \nof Irish Irelanders throughout the country who look \nto the militant LEADER as the exnonent \n0f their views and the most efficient organ of \nthe great National Revival as distinguished from that \nbrnnch of it--the Language Movement .

LEADER first saw the light, the Language \nMovement had not yet emerged from the Catacombs . \nI well remember I was passing through the metropolis \nabout the time. I had occasio·n to call on a distin­\nguished member of one of the great Regular Orders­\nhim~elf a well-known literary man, and now head of an \nimportant house abroad.

In th~ mineral water and h_op bitter industries \nMr. Governey gives employment to no less than 60 or 70 \nhands i~ the summer months, and every one of these \nbegan as boy·s in his place. Mr. Governey .manufac­\nt~res a proportion of the corks he uses, and he builds \nhis OiWn vans--and he has 21 vans on the road. It is \nevident that he is not anxious to buy anything that \nhe Cil,n produce, a disposition that it would be well for \nthe country were it more prevalent. The business mind \n-of Ireland is now, happily, turning towards productive \nindustries, and thoug4 the material results, so far, \nmay not be great, yet they are many and considerable \nAbout two years ago, some priests and people in Carlow \nivere an.-.::ious that something new should be attempted \nin the industrial world, and there was a public meeting \n·.caJled. A bacon factory was suggested; but eventually \na boot .factory found most favour. Mr. Governey had \nan interview with Mr. T'. P. Gill and an expert was sent \n<down. There were thr!3e ways of attempting to start \nth~ .. :hoot factory. One was on the co-operative plan, \n.an9ther was by means of a public comp any, and· the \nthird was by starting it as a one-man concern. For­\ntunately, Mr .Governey was prepared to take the risk \n.all on his own shoulders, and so the site of an old ruin \nis now covered by a modern , well-equipped and compact \nfactory. The problem of production was a difficult one. \nFor the task that Mr. Michael Governey, an extensive \nmineral water manufacturer, took upon himself was to \n-start a boot factory, though he possessed no practical \n-experience in that line-and more than that, start it \nin a town in which the industry was previously un­\nknown. He first had to procure the services of some \npeople from the boot manufacturing centres of England, \n.and then the training of the native workers commenced . \nAnyone who has had any experience in the trials and \n• troubles of starting a new industry can readily apprP-­\n•ciate the difficulty of Mr . Governey 's task. Last \n'Thursday week we were over the factory. About 45 \nCarlow hands are now employed there, in addition lo \n.the few fully experienced hands whom Mr . Governey \n.brought over to teach the industry. As this is not a. \n. technical journal, any detailed reference to technical \nprocesses would be out of place. Needless to say the \nprinciple of the division of labour is largely availed of, \n·.and the employees work at various ingenious machines. \nThe girls work at a great table in· a room to them­\nselves. The appearance of the place was thoroughly \nbusiness like, and it was pleasant to watch young, newly \ntr~ined hands pushing on with their special division of \n. the now much divided operation of turning out a \n• machine-made boot. Nothing but leather is used, and \nMr. ··Governey 1s of course anxious to use as much Irish \ntanned leather as possible on business principles. Mr . \n,Governey, a keen business man as well as an Irishman \n,of public spirit, has now solved the problem of pr~­\n<lucing machine-made boots in a town where no suc11 \n. industry before existed. It is now for the common \nsense Irish public to lend a hand to help in the problem \nof disti·ibution. Mr. Governey asks no customer of \nhis to: sacrifice as much as a ha'penny in the way of \n.bolstering up Carlow-made boots. He sells as a busi­\n;ness man, and claini.s that his boots can be sold by the \n:retailer at competitive prices on the open market. \n. 'The fact that one of the great English distributing .firms \n'ithat have many branches in Ireland, are large pur­\nchasers of his boots, indicates their power to stand \nthe test of competition. Up to this, ladies and chil­\ndren's. boots have been practically the sole. out-put of \nthe, factory. Attention is now being given to men's \nlboots. For our part, though we aFe not experts, the \n·boots that we saw appeared to us as exceptional value \nat the prices at which they could be sold by retail \nfirms. The output at present is, we believe, about 500 \npairs weekly; within a reasonable time it· could be in­\n.creased to 1,500 pairs weekly, and after that-well, \nCarlow has plenty of room for extended factories, and \nMr. Michael Governey is an enterprising man . \nThere is plenty of room for a dozen, an:d many a \ndozen, more boot factories in Ireland. A new boot fac­\ntory is a benefit to existing factories. We remember \nover four years ago, when we were looking for informa­\ntion for our \".Nation Building '' article on boots, we \nheard much at Winstanley's great factory in Dublin, \nabout the inconveniences of the lack of an adequate \nIrish labour market in the boot industry. Now with \nthriving factories in Waterford, Cork, Belfast, Dublin \nand Carlow, that difficulty is being overcome; and \nwith a good supply of trained labour, the expansion of \nthe boot industry ought to· be comparatively easy in the \nfuture. • \nThere is no boot shop in Ireland that ought not to \nhave a stock of boots from one or more, if not all, the \nIrish boot factories. If a pmchaser goes into a shop \nand wishes to buy Irish boots on their merits, it is a \nshame that he is not given an opportunity to do so, and \nthe time has come when the consumers should again \nrouse themselves and do a hand's turn for Irish industry \nby talking to the shop-keepers for the shop-keepers' . \nown good. The boot manufacturers of Ireland. sell on \nmerits, and they deserve support on their merits; and \nit is very difficult for customers to give that support if \nshop after shop they go into have not a sufficient range \nof Irish-made boots in stock. \nThere is a busy go-a-head air about Carlow town that \nis in pleasant contrast to the tumble-clown appearance \nof too many other Irish towns. The \" beauty that \nhovers round decay \" is all very well in its way. The \nbeautiful and massive ruins of Carlow Castle stand in \nthe grounds of Mr. Michael Governey. But if he owns \nthe beautiful ruins of an ancient castle, he has founded \ntwo productive industries within reach of their shadows \nA HISTORY OF IRISH MUSIC.\" ' \nM \nR GRATI'AN FLOOD 'S \"History of Irish Music \" \nl has been received with a universal welcome, and I \ngiladly join m y voice in the general chorus of congratulation . \nTh e book is the work of a lifetime, the result of careful, \nprolonged, indefatig;i,ble research, and the amount of in­\nformation presented to the reader is, truly wonderful. \nBut while admitting frel'>ly the many merits of the book. \nthe critic must, as a duty, point otit some · draw-backs. \nTh ese are principally two-a want of style and a want· ·of \ncritical judgment. Under the first aspect the author can­\nnot be excused from a fair amount of carelessness. The· in­\nformation soom , sometimes to be thrown in simply in a \nheap, without any attempt at order. To give an example, \nwe get some infonnation about Ogham writing in two para­\ngraphs on pp. 2 and 3. In the next paragraph this subject \nis left, and afte,r learning something from MacFirbis' MS. \nBook of Genealogies and the Dinn Seanchils., we \"·come to \nthe close of tl1e third century, when we are on fairly solid \nhistorical ground.\" Immediately· we ai',e canied back,, in \nthe next paragraph, to the fifth century before Christ, and \nwe also learn something about the Galatians iri the time of \nSt. Jerome. Fina.Uy, a.ftar all these excursions, we come \nback to the subject of Ogham writing. I am glad to sa.y \nthat the later cha.pters of the book are more satisfactory, \nalthough here, too, information is sometimas thrown in \n\"aprop_os of \" sometl1ing. An annoying feature here, how-· \never, is the waste of valuable space by meaninglesi< repeti­\nt.ions. Thus, a sentence about a letter of Sir Henry Syd­\nney, given on p. 160, occurs verbatim again on n. 174. The \nconstitution of Queen Elizabeth's Band of Musick is given \nboth on p. 166 and p. 177. The object of the Charitable \nMusical Society is explained three times-pp. 266, 268, \nand 282. .And so on. \nMore serious, however, are the strictures I have to make \nunder. the second heading-want of critical judgment.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once.

To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

At 28 it is hard to believe \nthat she has been in the business of \nproducing top selling albums for I 0 \nyears now. She is in Ireland for the \nfirst May Weekend where she and \nher band are headlining the Green \nGlens arena in Millstreet ... \nAt 18 years of age a young Scottish girl sat in a flat in \nGlasgow and penned her first song - the song was called \n\"I don't want a lover\" and brought her and her band to \nworld wide fame. Her record company was amazed at \nthe success of the song which still ten years later is \nbringing in healthy royalty money from airplay on radio \nstations all over the world. Sharon Spiteri was hailed as \nbeing a brillant singer and the band were the first British \nact to appear on MTV Unplugged. The band went on to \nproduce two more albums each extremely successful \nthen in 1994 the band start writing \"White on blonde\" \nwhich took 4 years to see the insides of a record shop. \nFour years is a long time in the music business and for \nmost people \"White on Blonde\" the latest album from \nTexas will have looked like a relaunch of the band. Many \nlistened sceptically as they were reminded of the Texas of \nold before hearing the comeback single \"Say what you \nwant\" but guess what? five months later and the bands \nalbum sales are climbing steadily and the second single \nreleased from the album has also been a huge success -\nthey are touring everywhere and people are asking just \nwhere were the band have been for the last number of \nyears. \nFor those wondering just where they have been, you'll \nfind the answer in the album. The music is different and \ndiverse from soul to pop from rock to hip hop you'll find \nall these elements in the album. Over the four years \nspent writing and recording this album the band have \nbusied themselves in various projects including working \nwith Hip Hop maestros Grand Central Crew and work­\ning with country rockers The Jayhawks ( one song on \ntheir final album features Sharon on vocals).

Enquiring where the rest of the band are brings a sly \nsnigger from the pair \"driving\" they respond in perfect harmony - not rel­\nishing the 200 odd mile road trip Niall and Eric had been saving their pen­\nnies to fly to Belfast. \nTwelve hours later and all the band are together rested and tucking into \nfree Heineken at Blackstaff Studios, home of BBC Northern Ireland. The \nband have just encountered a very bizarre Bus ride all of 80 yards from \nthe Hotel Europa to the Studios. Across the road from the side entrance \nof the hotel are the offices of the Ulster Unionist Party outside of which \nwere a small band of protesters from Ian Paisley's DUP trying their hard­\nest to chant \"No sell out to Dublin\" and generally heckle Unionist party \nmembers as they arrived from the Stormont talks. But a swelling band of \ngirls aged 8-15 were screaming their heads off across from them as they \neagerly awaited the arrival of Boyzone's Ronan Keating. The DUP crowd \nsoon gave up and went home. \nIn the green room in Blackstaff studios all the Hitchers are huddled In one \ncorner - are the Hitchers always this insular/ How come they're not hob­\nnobbing with the rich, beautiful and famous who's farts smell of laven-\nder? ... networking that's it!! how come they're not networking? \n\"I got Ronan Keatings autograph!\" enthuses Niall Quinn\" it's for my \nnieces though\" (yeah right Niall of course it is!).

      "raw_text": "Niall Quinn gives us an update on Limericks \nchances for promotion into the Priemiership \nand also begins to explain once more his views \non Scottish football ..... . \nCongratulations to Limerick FC who have qualified for \nthe play-offs in their bid for promotion by claiming \nthird place in Division one. This was done over the \nEaster weekend when Limerick chalked up their third \nconsecutive 2-1 victory - putting Monaghan Utd. to the \nsword and adding to the victories over St. Francis and \nBray Wanderers. The result earned in Monaghan left \nLimerick nine points clear of fourth placed Galway who \nhad to win their third last game of their campaign to \nkeep alive any hopes of catching Limerick. Galway \nFailed (yippee) losing 2-0 to Athlone and leaving \nLimerick out of reach. At the time of writing there is a \nmathematical possibility that our lads could claim sec­\nond place and automatic promotion. But by the time \nyou are reading this brand new, hot off the press DROP, \nBray Wanderers will probably have secured second \nplace as they need only one point from their last three \ngames. Surely not even Wicklow's finest can manage to \nthrow that away. So that leaves Limerick facing into a \nhome and away play off against third from the bottom \nof the premier division. That will most likely, though at \nthis stage by no means definitely, be UCO. But the stu­\ndents have rallied (sure jaysus isn't that all students ever \ndo!!) to escape their predicament scoring a last minute \nwinner in Cork over Easter that took them within \nthre~ points (gulp) of Derry City and with a (gulp! \nagain) game in hand. Now I've gone on about this \nbefore I know, but while I've seen lesser teams than \nLimerick get results out of Derry in recent times I find \nit extremely difficult to see us beating Derry over two \nlegs in a situation like this where their backs are to the \nwall. For all Derry's failings this season they are still \nreigning champions until St. Pats or Shellbourne wrench \nthe title from them any day now. I don't want to sound \npessimistic about the prospect of facing Derry I'm just \ntrying to temper expectations with a bit of realism. \nUCO on the other hand are well beatable infact I can \nsee us kicking the bollix off them home and away. \nThough in truth I reckon all concerned will emerge \nwith their collective manhood intact as brain rather \nthan brawn could be the key to negotiating this play off \nvictoriously. Remember UCO have had three or four \nseasons of mixing it with the big boys in the premier \ndivision. That has to be respected, by the same token \nUCO could look at Limerick as a bunch of bog war-\nriors coming up for a lesson in Champagne Football at \ntheir peril!! As their league position shows UCD's \nchampagne tastes a lot like Vervier. Limerick's League \ncampaign concludes this weekend away to \nHomefarm/Everton. \nFinally a Glasgow Celtic supporting pal of mine asked \nme to expand on my assertion from a few issues ago \nthat Scottish Football is \"stagnant and incestuous\" .. by \nthat I meant that Scotland has two teams; Glasgow \nRangers and Glasgow Celtic who kick the snot off the \nrest of the division to the point of banality while nei­\nther can win an argument in Europe. Furthermore, \nthese alleged giants would struggle to qualify for the \nUEFA cup if they were to play in the English \nPremiership division .. Rangers being as good as the cur­\nrent West Ham team and Celtic about as good as \nSheffield Wednesday. The ten teams in the Scottish \nPremier Division (half of whom would struggle in the \nNationwide Division One) play each other too often \n(four times a season) thus providing little breadth ~r \ndiversity of ... ah shag it I'm out of space. We'll talk \nabout it next time!!!!",
