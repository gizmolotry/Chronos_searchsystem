This is not the place to go into minute details as to how that end may be accomplished ; as, apart from the question of tactics, it would take up too much space, but one of the remedies may be referred to in brief. It is well known that at the present moment the Athletic Council holds hundreds of applications from members of the other bodies for reinstate- ment to the National Association, and that amongst the appli- cants aré numerous champions and ex-champions; men who must be relied on to make up international teams. Why not, under certain conditions, give these men a trial, or, in other words, reinstate them, or at all events reinstate such of them as the Council have sufficient faith in to adhere to their pledges? There is no crime in taking into the fold men who have seen the error of their ways, whether from a purely national standpoint or whether from the selfish standpoint of being enabled to compete with the alien Association. Through this medium I am convinced we could secure at least seventy-five per cent. of the alien bodies’ membership, and thus, while Associations without members may be objects to commiserate with, théy could scarcely be considered potent for good or evil. With the decks cleared of such bodies which have never reflected any credit on Ireland, and have always been prepared to relegate her to a position of obscurity as was instanced at the last Olympic games, the G.A.A. could go to the representatives of foreign countries, and, without fear of refusal, claim for Ireland her rightful place amongst the athletic nations of the world. This is one of my ideas to effect our athletic freedom; if it does not commend itself to others, let us have their schemes, for all will admit it does not brook delay. There can be no compromise, and there certainly can- not be any peace, until some Association or Associations go under, and that Association cannot be the G.A.A.",

We\nhave been sparring now for some years, and it is nearly time we\ncame to hard blows. This is not the place to go into minute\ndetails as to how that end may be accomplished ; as, apart from\nthe question of tactics, it would take up too much space, but one\nof the remedies may be referred to in brief. It is well known\nthat at the present moment the Athletic Council holds hundreds\nof applications from members of the other bodies for reinstate-\nment to the National Association, and that amongst the appli-\ncants aré numerous champions and ex-champions; men who\nmust be relied on to make up international teams. Why not,\nunder certain conditions, give these men a trial, or, in other\nwords, reinstate them, or at all events reinstate such of them as\nthe Council have sufficient faith in to adhere to their pledges?\nThere is no crime in taking into the fold men who have seen the\nerror of their ways, whether from a purely national standpoint\nor whether from the selfish standpoint of being enabled to\ncompete with the alien Association. Through this medium\nI am convinced we could secure at least seventy-five\nper cent. of the alien bodies’ membership, and thus,\nwhile Associations without members may be objects to\ncommiserate with, théy could scarcely be considered potent\nfor good or evil. With the decks cleared of such bodies\nwhich have never reflected any credit on Ireland, and have\nalways been prepared to relegate her to a position of obscurity\nas was instanced at the last Olympic games, the G.A.A. could\ngo to the representatives of foreign countries, and, without fear\nof refusal, claim for Ireland her rightful place amongst the\nathletic nations of the world. This is one of my ideas to effect\nour athletic freedom; if it does not commend itself to others,\nlet us have their schemes, for all will admit it does not brook\ndelay. There can be no compromise, and there certainly can-\nnot be any peace, until some Association or Associations go\nunder, and that Association cannot be the G.A.A.",

F'ur-\nther, our friendly critics would go so far as to suggest\nthat no player should be allowed to use his hands at\nall, either in taking the ball ‘‘in the air’’ or ‘‘on the\nhop,’” and that the ball should be played entirely on\nthe ground. In other words, they would have the\nG.A.A. authorities so to alter the present rules govern-\ning the playing of Gaelic Football that our matches\nwould become so many exhibitions of what may be\nbriefly called ‘‘Ground Football.’”",

At four minutes to go\n(as in No. 1 game) the teams were level. The tally read 21 points\neach. Then Anthony of Piltown lifted a ball midway in the wing.\nHis delightful wrist work helped him to send the sphere sailing\ngoalwards.

Pen_ning numerous TV shows such as the BBC television comedy \nsenes, Fore1g,1 Bodies , and various episodes of the popular soap, 'Glen roe', he has also written exten­\nsively for radio with his play, 'The Final Whistle' nominated for the 1992 Prix Italia and named as BBC's , \n\"1993 Play of the Year\". Now with his most recently penned prize, 'Happy Birthday Dear Alice', (com­\nmissioned and produced by Waterford's RED KETTLE Theatre Company), opening at the BELL TABLE \nthis J\\1onday, the L.E.G. scooped a few moment .s of the stage maestro's time and discovered why he \njumped career ship, shrugs off claims of \"lightweight\" work and believes he'll never ever find fame as a \nwriter of books. \nIn 1979 you were working with Sealink. In 1980 you \nwere a full-time playwright. How did this move come \nabout? \nWell, in 1979 l wrote my first play - a play called 'I Do Not \nLike Ti,ee Dr. Fell'. I didn't know who to send it to so I \nthought, \"I may as well start at the rop and send it to the \nAbbey,\" not actually thinking anything would happen to \nit. But, any,.vay, they accepted it and it went on in the Pea­\ncock in '79 and then it transferred to the Abbe y. By that \nti..rne 1 haci starteci to wr ite m v ,;econd play, 'Canaries'. N ow \nin 1980, I was walking ac;oss Abbe y Street in Dublin, \nheading back to work at North Wall and 1 met Joe Dowlin g \nwho was Artistic Director of the Abbe y at the time. He said \nto me, \"We have your second pla_, 'Ca11aries'. We 've been \nreading it. We like it. And w e w ant to put it on in The \nAbbey as part of the Dub lin T heatre Festival. ls that all \nright with you !\" Well, yes ! believe me - it wa s quite all \nright !

Pen_ning numerous TV shows such as the BBC television comedy \nsenes, Fore1g,1 Bodies , and various episodes of the popular soap, 'Glen roe', he has also written exten­\nsively for radio with his play, 'The Final Whistle' nominated for the 1992 Prix Italia and named as BBC's , \n\"1993 Play of the Year\". Now with his most recently penned prize, 'Happy Birthday Dear Alice', (com­\nmissioned and produced by Waterford's RED KETTLE Theatre Company), opening at the BELL TABLE \nthis J\\1onday, the L.E.G. scooped a few moment .s of the stage maestro's time and discovered why he \njumped career ship, shrugs off claims of \"lightweight\" work and believes he'll never ever find fame as a \nwriter of books. \nIn 1979 you were working with Sealink. In 1980 you \nwere a full-time playwright. How did this move come \nabout? \nWell, in 1979 l wrote my first play - a play called 'I Do Not \nLike Ti,ee Dr. Fell'. I didn't know who to send it to so I \nthought, \"I may as well start at the rop and send it to the \nAbbey,\" not actually thinking anything would happen to \nit. But, any,.vay, they accepted it and it went on in the Pea­\ncock in '79 and then it transferred to the Abbe y. By that \nti..rne 1 haci starteci to wr ite m v ,;econd play, 'Canaries'. N ow \nin 1980, I was walking ac;oss Abbe y Street in Dublin, \nheading back to work at North Wall and 1 met Joe Dowlin g \nwho was Artistic Director of the Abbe y at the time. He said \nto me, \"We have your second pla_, 'Ca11aries'. We 've been \nreading it. We like it. And w e w ant to put it on in The \nAbbey as part of the Dub lin T heatre Festival. ls that all \nright with you !\" Well, yes ! believe me - it wa s quite all \nright ! So I went straight dcwT, to Sealink from there and. \nhanded _ in my resignation. \nDid you ever regret that decision? \nNo . Never .

Pen_ning numerous TV shows such as the BBC television comedy \nsenes, Fore1g,1 Bodies , and various episodes of the popular soap, 'Glen roe', he has also written exten­\nsively for radio with his play, 'The Final Whistle' nominated for the 1992 Prix Italia and named as BBC's , \n\"1993 Play of the Year\". Now with his most recently penned prize, 'Happy Birthday Dear Alice', (com­\nmissioned and produced by Waterford's RED KETTLE Theatre Company), opening at the BELL TABLE \nthis J\\1onday, the L.E.G. scooped a few moment .s of the stage maestro's time and discovered why he \njumped career ship, shrugs off claims of \"lightweight\" work and believes he'll never ever find fame as a \nwriter of books. \nIn 1979 you were working with Sealink. In 1980 you \nwere a full-time playwright. How did this move come \nabout? \nWell, in 1979 l wrote my first play - a play called 'I Do Not \nLike Ti,ee Dr. Fell'. I didn't know who to send it to so I \nthought, \"I may as well start at the rop and send it to the \nAbbey,\" not actually thinking anything would happen to \nit. But, any,.vay, they accepted it and it went on in the Pea­\ncock in '79 and then it transferred to the Abbe y. By that \nti..rne 1 haci starteci to wr ite m v ,;econd play, 'Canaries'. N ow \nin 1980, I was walking ac;oss Abbe y Street in Dublin, \nheading back to work at North Wall and 1 met Joe Dowlin g \nwho was Artistic Director of the Abbe y at the time. He said \nto me, \"We have your second pla_, 'Ca11aries'. We 've been \nreading it. We like it. And w e w ant to put it on in The \nAbbey as part of the Dub lin T heatre Festival. ls that all \nright with you !\" Well, yes ! believe me - it wa s quite all \nright ! So I went straight dcwT, to Sealink from there and. \nhanded _ in my resignation. \nDid you ever regret that decision? \nNo . Never . Even though it w as a great.step - I had been \nworking there for 15 years and this meant leaving it w ith­\nout a pension, without all the free travel, without anything \nat all except one play down and another play abo~t tog~ \non -what actually happened after that w as that basically, -\nw r te a play every year. A lot of this was dow n to Joe \nDowlin g because he was extremely encouraging and as \nsoon as Canaries went on and was successful, he then com­\n\"Right ! they're all here because it's O pening Nig ht but \nw ho's go ing to be here tom orrow night ?!\" A nd it just \nama zed m e that for the next 6 wee ks the play packed out \nthe Peacock, l w as staggered by that. T hen it m n.ved to T he \nAbb ey whi ch is a 700 seater and it d id great there ton -I'm \nalw ays ama zed at all-these wo nderful strangers w ho com e \nto see m y plays ! \nDid you always harbour ambition s to be a playwright ? \nNo - but I harboured amb itions to be a w riter. From the \ntim e I w as·in school l was w riting short stories and poetry \nfor various news papers but l wa s collecting mor e rejection \nslips than getting stories published I Th en l started to wr ite \na novel and \\ wa s half wa y through that bu t it w as really \nboring m e• 'And if it was boring m e , and l w as w riting it, \nGo d only knows wha t it wa s going tn do to others w ho \nmight read it ! I suppose what i was trying to do w as find \nthe right m edium in w hich to w ork. Th en by sheer chance \nthere wa s a theatre wo rkshop wi th L,rntern Theatre in \nDubl i1i and l went along to that and thought m aybe I \nshould try and w rite a play. And I d id. \nYour work , on occasion, ha s b een d escribed a s \n• 'lightweight'. How do you feel about that? \nW ell, 1 don't min d that at all. I think that all the plays are \nquite d ifferent. So m e of them a re deep and harrow ing. and \nsom e of them are just fun, bu f all of them are com edies. I \nthink a lot of connotations are formed w hen critics go to \nthe theatre and if they hear the audience laughing, imm e-\nd iately think _that this is som eone w ho's telling jokes -\nmissioned a play a year from-----------------------, \nme for the Abbey and I did 99 \nthat for three years.\" ••• Comedy can often \nWh ich is to misinterpret what \ncom ed y is all about. Come dy \ncan often be a weapon . It can \nsew the krnfe in in a way that \nyou don't feel it. How did you feel about your \nvery first play premiering at \nThe Abbey? \nYe s, having your first play to \nbe premiered in the N ational \nTheatre is quite an ach ieve­\nment. It was a scream , \nthough. You see, before the \nplay opene~d I was \nannouncing it, advertising it, I \nalways felt \"this is my \nbe a weapon . I t can \nsew the knif e in a way i \nthat you d oi,tt feel \n\\ \" it .. \nmoment of glory, because L----------------------' \nls this wh y yo u turned to com­\nedy ? \nYes it is though it was n't that I \nreally 'turned' to com edy, I just \ncouldn't do .1nyth1ng else. If \nsom ebody p u t a gun to m y \n-herid ,an d sn id, \"Write \" \ntragedy \", I probably couldn't \n. .. Thou gh if they had a gun to \nm y head - I'd probably try 1 \nHow long would it u sually \nonce the play opens every- . \nbody will see what a load of rubbish it is !''. On the first take you to write a play ? . \nWell, I try to do w ork from nine to five every day. certa111-\nly l w ould do som e wo rk every day. Th e first plc1 y I wro te ni ht the place was packed with all the people I used to \nw~rk with, with my friends, and I could und~rstand, \nPlaywright Bernard Farrell \ntook nine m onths and it was literally like a pregna ncy and \nbirth. Since then I 've wo rked it out that it takes app roxi­\nm ately nine m onths to w rite each of them . \nYou 've done a lot of work for radio and television. What \nwas that like? \nI love doing stuff for radio. I find that mu ch easier thc1n \nwriting for stage. Television was great too. I really enjoyed \nwriting for 'C/e11roe' but l actually enjoyed it too mu ch ! I \ndidn't think I was going to stay w ith it for as long as I did \n-l was with it for 3 years. A n d by the end of the three years \nthere we re so m any plays I knew I had to get back to wr it-\ning. _ \nAnd the novel ? Will that ever be completed ? \nO h I Th e boring novel ! It's in a ·drawer some w here and 1 \nstill do n't think I w ould be prepared to look at it now -I'd \nbe so emb arrassed ! I'll probably never go near it again \nand I don't know if I've even taken any ideas from it. \nWhat do you think of Irish theatre today? \nI think it's very healthy. 1 think the m ajor playwrights are \nstill turning out good w orks and - as important - I think \nthat a lot of theatre comp anies are now going out to play­\nw rights, asking them to w rite plays for them which is \ngreat, and holding their hand throughout. 1 mean, loo k at \nRed Kettle. This, Happy Birthday D ear Alice, 1s the second \nplay I've written for them , the first being Forty Fo11r \nSyca111ore. l really loved working with th.em : They were so \ngenerous and caring and willing to take a chance. A lot of \ntheatre compani es are afraid, wondering will a commi s­\nsioned play work out but nobod y will know unless they \ntry and Red Kettle really went for it. 1 honestly think that \nat this m oment in time they are one of. the best theatre \ncompanie s in the country. • \nOf all the plays you've written, which is your favourite? \nThe last one is always ·the favourite. Wouldn't it be terrible \nif you had written 14 plays and you kept thinking \"Oh, the \nfifth\", or \"the second\", were the best! No -Definitely, my \nfavourite at the moment is 'Happy Birtl,day Dear Alice'. \nINTERVIEW: SIOBHAN COLGAN \n(Happy Birtltday Dear Alice opens at the Bell table Arts \nCentre on Monday 6 March and runs until Saturd·ay 18 \nMarch. It follows another llERNARD FARRELL stage \nplay Tire Last Apaclte Re1111io11 which continues at the \nBell,table until Saturday 4 March. Details on (061) \n319866) \n-•· . .. '",

          "raw_text": "Thursday August 17th -Wednesday August 30th• LI I ERIC IC EV EN TS Ii U IDE \nASH \n'Girl From Mars' \nFor this their new single ASH have taken a sharp turn \nfrom the coy reminiscing that made the recently \nreleased UNCLE PAT such a hit.The martial arts refer­\nences of KUNG FU have been abandoned in favour of \nplanetary references which convey the far out nature \nof Tim Wheelers lost love.The song opens w ith yo ung \nTim 's strained voice lamenting the girl wh o never \nknew of his love for her,before crashing into the usual \nmael strom of distorted guitar ,heaving bass and disap­\npointing ly lightweight drums .Produced by form er \nCure bass player Phil Th omally,it successfully vari­\nates on a so far winning formul a and even includes a \npiano overdub.Let's hop e Tim gets his by now infa­\nm o us A Levels and doesn't have to spend another \nyea r giving the teachers notes asking them to leave \nhim off his home w ork because he's go ing on tour w ith \nElastica.A sure fire hit. \nTHE HERM \n'DEMO TAPE' \nWith the current crop of yo un ger band s such as \nSUPERGRASS et al wanting nothing m ore than to \nfeel \"Alright\", I must admit a certain am ount of baf­\nflement at the emergence of band s such as THE \nHERM . From the five song s on the tape one cannot \nbut get the impression that they take them selves very \nseriously. Hailing from in and around the city ,the \nH erm have been on the go for a year or so now gigging \naround various hostelries. \nI mu st concede that I was very excited listening to the \nopen ing bars of the first song. Okay so the four chords \nit's based around have been done to death but for m e \nit was the voca ls w hich enthralled, managing to get \nuncannily close to \"slow ly goes the night\" era of Nick \nCave .Unfortunately , the said vocalist soon decided \nthat rather than sounding like Australia's greatest \nCabaret singer, he'd like to emulate the 'least articu­\nlate man to scream in.to a Shure SM5 8' -yes I am talking \nabout Eddie Vedder . Despite relatively goo d sound \nquality(especially in the context of dem o tapes) ,on \nsome tracks it was impossible to work out the lyrics. \nThat said,when they were coherent,they seemed \nsomewhat disjointed and perhaps relying too much \non the usual rock cliches : \"Darkest dreams , deepest \nfears\"etc. The instrumentation is top notch with good \nbalance between th~ musicians and this alone.should \nhold them in good stead. Herm show considerable \npromise but they really ought to lighten up.

The statement \nfinished with a profound declaration that 'the Irish Government are \ndetermined to take every necessary step to stamp out this German Plot'. \nOn the basis of this spurious claim, most of the leadership of the \nVolunteers and Sinn Fein were arrested on 17 and 18 of May. Among \nthose that were arrested were Eamon de Valera, Countess Markievicz, \nArthur Griffith, Darrell Figgis, Joseph McGuinness, Joseph McGrath \nand William T Cosgrave.

The Limerick Chronicle of 31 \nMay 1918 records that police under Sergeant McCarthy raided the City \nPrinting Works in Rutland Street in search of 'material relative to the \nalleged German Plot'. Nothing of an incriminating matter was found but \nthe raid seemed to reflect the manner in which the authorities seemed to \nbe clutching at straws to justify their course of action. \nAs the impact of the arrests began to take effect the public perception \nin Ireland began to see the moves by the authorities as a cynical if clumsy \nattempt to remove the leadership of Sinn Fein and the Republican \nMovement. The ultimate losers were going to be the Irish Nationalist Party \nand as the summer of 1918 unfolded a number of them began to realise \nthis. The ham-fisted policies of the British Authorities, in Ireland, were \n195 T p C 1m at oogan,De Valera-Long Fellow, Long Shadow, (London 1993) p.110 \nRe-organisation, Dissension and the Threat of Conscription 1917-1918 185 \ngoing to make it more and more difficult for them in any future electoral \ncontest with Sinn Fein. In August 1918 a number of them took issue \nwith Mr Shortt in the House of Commons. Joe Devlin, the Nationalist \nMP for West Belfast, and one of the few Nationalist Party MPs who \nwas still in touch with his electorate, declared that the 'German Plot was \nthe outcome of the imagination of the Chief Secretary'. In the course \nof his speech Devlin declared that he believed that the administration \nwas trying to solve the Irish Qyestion by getting rid of the 'present Irish \nrepresentatives'.

This decision was influenced by what \nthey believed was a move for change occasioned by the response to the \nexecutions of 1916. The intervention of Edward Thomas O'Dwyer the \nCatholic Bishop of Limerick had given a respectability to Republican \naspirations that it might not otherwise have had. \nThe candidate chosen to represent Sinn Fein, Count George Plunkett, \nwas the 66-year-old father of one of the executed signatories of the \n1916 procla111ation. The Roscommon By-election provided a brilliant \nfocus and platform for the Sinn Fein organisation just as many of its \nmost prominent members were emerging from internment. In the \nevent Plunkett was victorious by 3,022 votes to Devine's 1708 votes \nwith Tully tailed off in third place with 687 votes. By any measure it was \na resounding victory and it proved to be the shot in the arm that the \nRepublicajn Movement and Sinn Fein was seeking. Patrick O'Connell \nof Foynes gives a very interesting insight into the impact of Plunkett's \nvictory in the west Limerick area. A huge bonfire was lit in Foynes \nvillage and the Sinn Fein supporters celebrated by singing nationalist \nsongs well into the night. Eleven men were arrested and charged with \n'lighting and making use of a fire in the neighbourhood of Foynes \nwithout permission of the competent Naval or Military authority'.

As \nalways the Police authorities had succeeded in making heroes through \ntheir shortsightedness because Jackson emerged one month later to a \nwelcome fit for a hero.198 On the morning of Thursday 25 April, the \nauthorities exacted retribution on the young men who demonstrated \nin William Street and 18 of them were arrested at their homes in the \nearly hours of that morning.

He was also tried by court-martial \nat Richmond Barracks in Dublin in January 1917 and, despite a very \nable defence, mounted by Tim Healy and John Power, Hugh O'Brien-\n199 Weekly Observer 28 April 1917 \n200 Hugh O'Brien-Moran (1886-1950) was a son of James Hishon Moran a Solicitor with \nstrong nationalist credentials.James H Moran had himself been jailed during the Land \nWar for making a seditious speech at Ballyneety in 1889. The older Moran was a close \nfriend of William O'Brien, who was unmarried and stood as Godfather to Moran's son, \nhence the O'Brien which was used as a form of Christian name. Hugh O'Brien Moran \nwent on to become the State Solicitor for the Limerick area. He lived at Landscape \nHouse near Clonlara in County Clare. - Information received from a family document \nper David O 'Mahoney, grandson to Hugh O'Brien-Moran. \n201 Mungret Annual Year book ofMungret College (1927) p.21 \nBy-elections and Prison Terms 1917-1919 189 \nMoran was found guilty and sentenced to six months in prison without \nhard labour. It was actions such as these, where it was felt that ordinary \nRIC men had acted with unwarranted arrogance that contributed to the \nostracisation of the police and their families as much as any politically \nmotivated actions.202 When O'Brien-Moran's arrived back in Limerick \non 23 March, he was accorded a very enthusiastic welcome by a large \ncrowd. Indeed a demonstration against the police by some of the crowd \nlater led to fu;ther court charges. 203 \nOn 9 May 1917 Sinn Fein contested a by-election in Longford South. As \nwas the case in Roscommon Longford South had been an uncontested \nconstituency since 1892 and effectively whilst the ordinary people of \nIreland might have gained the vote in 1884 204 they rarely got a chance \nto exercise it because the Nationalist Party candidate was rarely \nchallenged. The Nationalist Party candidate was a man named Patrick \nMcKenna and Sinn Fein had nominated Joseph McGuinness who \nwas at that stage serving time in prison. The slogan that the Sinn Fein \norganisers used was one of 'Put him in - to get him out'. The slogan \nseemed to catch on and it galvanised McGuinness's campaign. In the \nevent Sinn Fein won the election by the very narrow margin of 32 \nvotes. On the evening that the election result was announced there \nwere widespread celebrations throughout the country. In Ballylanders \nthe Volunteers used the occasion to have a full-scale mobilisation \nof the local company and some of the other neighbouring volunteer \ncompanies. The parade culminated in a torchlight procession through \nthe village. Two RIC men attempted to stand in the way of the \nprocession but when threatened with a lighting torch they were forced \nto back away. 205 \n202 Weekly Observer18 Nov 1916 and 10 February 1917 \n203 Weekly Observer 7 April 1917 \n204 Under the Representation ofThe People Act of 1884 householders were given a vote on \nthe payment of a once off fee. - Byrnes, Dictionary of Irish Local History (Dublin 2004) \np.127 \n205 WIS 435 Witness Statement ofTadhg Crowley (Bureau of Military History)",

Reynolds208 \nand O'Brien received £10 and £35 respectively2°9• \nLater the same year Ned Tobin and John Fogarty of the Glenbrohane \nCompany were arrested for being caught in possession of a pistol. Tobin \nin his statement maintained that it was an old pistol and of no practical \nuse yet it was sufficient grounds for having himself and Fogarty sent \nto Cork for trial. Constable Cullen of Ballylanders gave evidence for \nthe Prosecution. When challenged by Tobin as to whether he himself \nwould be able to kill someone with the pistol the constable had to admit \nthat the weapon was not capable of killing anyone. On the basis of this \nadmission both Tobin and Fogarty were released and returned home \nin triumph. \nThroughout 1917 and 1918 the police authorities continued a form of \npetty harassment intended to keep the Volunteers distracted. This form \nof harassment generally took the form of arrests and charges on relatively \nminor issues but it was beginning to form a pattern of serious division \nbetween the RIC and their families and their nationalist neighbours. \nIn October 1917 Ned Punch of Frederick Place in Limerick city was \ntried for the unsuccessful attack on two RIC men Constables Lavelle \nand O'Sullivan on 16 September of that year. Punch, along with two \nother volunteers, had held up the two policemen at Ballinacurra in an \neffort to disarm them. Apparently the revolver they used for the hold \nup was faulty and when the two policemen resisted, the hold up had to \nbe aborted and Punch and his companions tried to make their escape. \nUnfortunately, for Punch, it appears that the RIC men identified him \nas the slowest of the three and they managed to catch up with him \nand affect his arrest. Punch was later tried before a court-martial in \nDublin in which W E Wylie prosecuted. Punch refused to recognise \nthe court and he was sentenced to five years penal servitude. However, \nhe was released in November 1917, under the 'Cat and Mouse' Act, \nafter serving a little over six weeks of his sentence.

They \nwould signal this information to Treacy when they arrived at Knock.long. \nHogan meanwhile had been placed on the evening train at Thurles \nrailway station. His escort consisted of a sergeant and three constables. \nSergeant Peter Wallace, who had been in charge of the raiding party that \ncaptured Hogan at Annfield on Monday morning, was in charge of the \nescort. Constables Jeremiah Ring and John O'Reilly had also been part \nof the raiding party at Annfield. The fourth member of the escort was \nConstable Michael Enright, a native ofLickadoon near Ballyneety, who \nhad been on leave in Limerick over the week-end and had just returned \nto duty on Monday morning. Enright was the only one of the escort \nactually stationed at Thurles. The other three were based at Roskeen \nalthough O'Reilly and Ring were only on temporary secondment on \naccount of the imposition of Martial Law. Hogan and his escort were \nsituated in the first carriage in a compartment backing on to the engine. \nHogan was seated with his back to the engine with Michael Enright on \nhis inside and Sergeant Wallace on the outside close to the door. Ring \nand O'Reilly sat on the opposite seat with their rifles in the upright \nposition. Wallace and Enright had revolvers drawn. \nWhen the unarmed Galbally men had gone to Emly Treacy broke \nhis own party into two groups to avoid attracting attention. Breen and \nRobinson cycled together to Knock.long. Their responsibility being to \ncover the exit and to ensure that the train did not pull out until a rescue \nwas completed. Treacy and Ned O'Brien, both armed with revolvers \nwere to constitute the main rescue party. To add a further complication \nto Treacy's plan they could not predict the exact time of arrival of the \nupward evening train from Cork to Dublin. Sometimes the two trains \nmet at Knock.long and sometimes the Dublin train arrived before the \nCork train. Neither could they predict if there would be armed police \nor military on either train. As it transpired the Cork train arrived in \nstation and departed from Knock.long just as the Dublin train arrived. \nA party of police from Galbally had alighted from the Cork train and \nmade their way from the station. Fortunately for Treacy's plans they \nwere well on the road to Galbally when the Dublin train arrived. It \n1he Rescue at Knocklong and its Aftermath 227 \nwas 7.45 pm,when Treacy and O'Brien arrived in Knock.long. They had \nspotted the Galbally RIC and stayed out of their way as they waited for \nthe Dublin train. They still had 20 minutes to while away and Treacy \nsent O'Brien in search ofThomas Shanahan, to see if any telegrams had \nbeen received. As it transpired Shanahan had received a telegram from \nMay Moloney, but as he had not been appraised by Davy Burke, the \ntelegram mystified him as it also happened, by coincidence, to overlap \nwith his ctwn private dealings in greyhounds. He handed over the \ntelegram that read 'greyhound in Thurles still'. This meant that Hogan \nwas not on the train. \nBy the time O'Brien got back to the station Shanahan arrived with a \nfresh telegram but at that stage the Dublin train could be seen coming \ndown the line. When the train arrived in the station John Joe O'Brien \njumped on to the platform and pointed out, to his brother and Treacy, \nthe carriage and compartment that Hogan and his escort were in.262 \nTreacy then drew his revolver and followed by O'Brien and the unarmed \nGalbally men they entered the carriage. When they threw open the door \nof the compartment the police were taken completely by surprise and it \nlooked for a second as if the rescue would be bloodless. Enright, who was \nseated inside Hogan, appeared to menace the prisoner with his revolver \nand both Treacy and O'Brien fired simultaneously. Michael Enright, a \n35-year-old, single man, dropped dead as he was shot through the heart. \nThis has often been a point of contention that the IRA men opened fire \nwithout reason but the statement of District Inspector McLean, who \ninvestigated the case, stated that Enright sought to 'restrain Hogan'. \nIt was admitted, in the same statement, that when challenged to put \nhis hands up Sergeant Wallace replied 'not likely'.263 Following the \nshooting a tremendous struggle ensued between Sergeant Wallace and \nSean Treacy for possession of the sergeant's service revolver because \nTreacy had lost his own at the start of the fracas. \nThe efforts of others to get involved or to give assistance were \nconstrained by the lack of space in the compartment and the corridor \n262 W/S 1647 Witness Statement ofJohn Joe O'Brien (Bureau of Military History) p.9 \n263 County 904/41 (British National Archives, Kew)",

It looked all\nover for us at that stage but we\nshowed spirit and determination\nthat had been lacking all season.\n\nShots rained in on the Glin",

Now, I have·no \nfears on this score in regard to men of the John Martfo \nor Mitchell or Douglas Hyde stamp, whose co-operation \nis worth having, and for whom we have never been want ­\ning in respect and gratitude.

Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

That 'article which appeared 'in our issue of \nNovember 10th, 1900, was on Boots. We frnd, on \nreferring back to it, that our appr~ximate calculation, \nassuming that all the leather used m the boots had 'to \nbe imported-and as a matter of fact that was not, or is \nnot, so-was that about £800,000• a year would go to \nshoeing the population of Ireland. Our information \nat the time was t4at not one-tenth of that sum was \nkept in the country, or in other words, that £720,000 \nwas lost to it because Ireland did not shoe itself. • Since \nthen a considerable improvement has be~n effected .. \nWinstanley's is the largest boot factory in Ireland, and \nin our Christmas Number, December, 190·3, they an­\nnounced that they employed over 300 workers in their \nfactory, and found that number insufficient to execute \nall orders, and added, \" skilled labour urgently l·e­\nquired.\" The Lee B'oots, of Cork; Hearn and Cahill, \nof \\V'aterford; Williamson's, of Belfast, no doubt also \nconsiderably expanded their output; but in view of our \napproximate calculation four and a half years ago, that \neven assuming that Ireland imported all the leather \nused in the boots made-which she does n-ot, and the \ntanning industry is capable of great development--that \nthe country paid to foreign makers £720>,000 annually \non the head of ·boots, there is a great margin left to be \nworked upon. There is a good deal of picking on \n£720 ,000· a year, and notwithstanding the considerable \nadvance that has been made in the way of the Irish \nconsumers giving up playing the fool by supporting \nforeign boots when Irish boots were to be had as good \nand as cheap, there is still a great deal of work left for \nthe common-sense Irish boot-buyer to do. Every reader \nof the LEADER is a purchaser of boots, anc} we put it to \nthe intellect of each one of them that they should de­\nmand in the shops in .which they deal that they be \nenabled to sample Irish-made boots that are fighting \nin competition with foreign boots. If they find them \nright as regards quality and price, they should most un­\ndoubtedly give them the preference. If our· readers \nfind that the shops in. which they deal do not offer a \nfair opportunity to their customers to-sample and use \ntheir own judgment on the merits of Irish-made boots \nas against British and foreign boots, they ought, in fair­\nness to the industrial inte1:ests of the country, to \nspeak firmly to, and what is more, act firmly with, \nsuch shop-keepers. Irish boots are entitled ·to a fair. \nfield and no favour in the shops of Ireland th.at deal in \nboots, and our readers should see as far as they reason• \nably may do so, that they get it. The boot manufac­\nturers of Ireland have rio right to ask the public for as \nmuch as,~ brass farthing for nothing, but they are en­\ntit~~!!. to a preference from the Irish buying public on \ntheir merits. We put the case this way :-It is common \nsense that the w:hole_ country benefits by the prosperity .. \nof the boot-makmg mdustry; the common-sense public \nwho read the LEADER are not asked -to make any sacri­\nfice for the sake of the special boot-making interest, but \nthey are, as common-sense, thinking people, asked to \nsee that they do not make a sacrifice for the benefit of \nBritish and American boot manufactm·ers; they a.re \nasked _to see t~at Irish-made boots get a fair field. We \nrepudiate the idea that they are entitled to any favour \nbeyond that, other things being equal, Irish boots, as \na matt~r of common sense, should ·get the preference \nfrom Irish boot _wearers ... We say that·eyery Irish boot \nshop should be m a pos1t1on. to show its customers fair \nsamples of the products of the several Irish boot factories. • \n. • The boot factory of Mr. Michael Governey, of Oarlow, \n1s a r«:_c~nt grow~h of the Industrial Revival. Mr . \nGov~rney . (tradm~ as Corcoran and Co.) is \nan extensive mmeral . water manufacturer also \na _manufl!,ctur~r, or _brewer, of hop bitters'. We \nspe~t several mtere~tmg hours looking over both fac­\ntories. Many of his mineral water machines are the \ninve~tion of _an Irishman, almost needless to say, the \n• 1Jart1cular Inshman had to go over to Britain _with his \nI \nl",

P. \nMoran editor of this journal. • These three were \ntreated to foot-pad tactics by the blackguards acting \nprofessedly in the name of the Gaelic_ Le:i,gue, and_ the \n·Executive Committee of that Orgamsat10n has, m a. \n• sense, attempted to affiliate the League with this str~et \nblackguardism by refusing tq denou~ce a~d apologise \nfor the criminal outrage openly c?mm1tt?d 11_1 the_ name \nof the Gaelic League. Yet at this meet.mg 111 Shgo we \n• are told by the President .of the Gaehc League that \n\" The motto of the-Gaelic League was the open door to \nall Irishmen, 110 matt~r wha:t. their. religion, \nno matter what thell\" politics might be.\" \nWhich is right, the President or the majority of the \nExecutive 1 The President says \" the open door;\" \"the \nmajority at the last meeting of the Executive sidEl with \ncriminal street blackguardism and the \"shut, door.\" \nDr. Hyde was not at the l,~st meeting ?! the_ ExecutivP. \nand as he stands for t;he open door, he. 1s presum­\nably at variance with the vote of t~e Executive. Wh~ t \ndoes Dr. Douglas Hyde , as President of the Gaehc \nL eague think 1 • \nDr. Douglas Hyde , the ]:>resident of the ~aelic \nLcaaue went on :-\" Upon their platform, Cathohc and \nProtestant and Dissenter, stood together, and they were \nknit in bonds of the closest friendship. That word was \nto0 weak-they were knit together in b~nds of a \nbrotherly love that had been unexampled _m _Ireland \nin recent times.\" For our part we are mchned to­\nthink that Dr. McWalter, T .C ., would in one sense, em ~ \nphatically agree that Irishmen on a recent Sunday \n\" were knit together i_n bonds of_ a brother!y lo;; th..i,t \nhacl been imexam pled m Ireland m recent times_.

In th~ mineral water and h_op bitter industries \nMr. Governey gives employment to no less than 60 or 70 \nhands i~ the summer months, and every one of these \nbegan as boy·s in his place. Mr. Governey .manufac­\nt~res a proportion of the corks he uses, and he builds \nhis OiWn vans--and he has 21 vans on the road. It is \nevident that he is not anxious to buy anything that \nhe Cil,n produce, a disposition that it would be well for \nthe country were it more prevalent. The business mind \n-of Ireland is now, happily, turning towards productive \nindustries, and thoug4 the material results, so far, \nmay not be great, yet they are many and considerable \nAbout two years ago, some priests and people in Carlow \nivere an.-.::ious that something new should be attempted \nin the industrial world, and there was a public meeting \n·.caJled. A bacon factory was suggested; but eventually \na boot .factory found most favour. Mr. Governey had \nan interview with Mr. T'. P. Gill and an expert was sent \n<down. There were thr!3e ways of attempting to start \nth~ .. :hoot factory. One was on the co-operative plan, \n.an9ther was by means of a public comp any, and· the \nthird was by starting it as a one-man concern. For­\ntunately, Mr .Governey was prepared to take the risk \n.all on his own shoulders, and so the site of an old ruin \nis now covered by a modern , well-equipped and compact \nfactory. The problem of production was a difficult one. \nFor the task that Mr. Michael Governey, an extensive \nmineral water manufacturer, took upon himself was to \n-start a boot factory, though he possessed no practical \n-experience in that line-and more than that, start it \nin a town in which the industry was previously un­\nknown. He first had to procure the services of some \npeople from the boot manufacturing centres of England, \n.and then the training of the native workers commenced . \nAnyone who has had any experience in the trials and \n• troubles of starting a new industry can readily apprP-­\n•ciate the difficulty of Mr . Governey 's task. Last \n'Thursday week we were over the factory. About 45 \nCarlow hands are now employed there, in addition lo \n.the few fully experienced hands whom Mr . Governey \n.brought over to teach the industry. As this is not a. \n. technical journal, any detailed reference to technical \nprocesses would be out of place. Needless to say the \nprinciple of the division of labour is largely availed of, \n·.and the employees work at various ingenious machines. \nThe girls work at a great table in· a room to them­\nselves. The appearance of the place was thoroughly \nbusiness like, and it was pleasant to watch young, newly \ntr~ined hands pushing on with their special division of \n. the now much divided operation of turning out a \n• machine-made boot. Nothing but leather is used, and \nMr. ··Governey 1s of course anxious to use as much Irish \ntanned leather as possible on business principles. Mr . \n,Governey, a keen business man as well as an Irishman \n,of public spirit, has now solved the problem of pr~­\n<lucing machine-made boots in a town where no suc11 \n. industry before existed. It is now for the common \nsense Irish public to lend a hand to help in the problem \nof disti·ibution. Mr. Governey asks no customer of \nhis to: sacrifice as much as a ha'penny in the way of \n.bolstering up Carlow-made boots. He sells as a busi­\n;ness man, and claini.s that his boots can be sold by the \n:retailer at competitive prices on the open market. \n. 'The fact that one of the great English distributing .firms \n'ithat have many branches in Ireland, are large pur­\nchasers of his boots, indicates their power to stand \nthe test of competition. Up to this, ladies and chil­\ndren's. boots have been practically the sole. out-put of \nthe, factory. Attention is now being given to men's \nlboots. For our part, though we aFe not experts, the \n·boots that we saw appeared to us as exceptional value \nat the prices at which they could be sold by retail \nfirms. The output at present is, we believe, about 500 \npairs weekly; within a reasonable time it· could be in­\n.creased to 1,500 pairs weekly, and after that-well, \nCarlow has plenty of room for extended factories, and \nMr. Michael Governey is an enterprising man . \nThere is plenty of room for a dozen, an:d many a \ndozen, more boot factories in Ireland. A new boot fac­\ntory is a benefit to existing factories. We remember \nover four years ago, when we were looking for informa­\ntion for our \".Nation Building '' article on boots, we \nheard much at Winstanley's great factory in Dublin, \nabout the inconveniences of the lack of an adequate \nIrish labour market in the boot industry. Now with \nthriving factories in Waterford, Cork, Belfast, Dublin \nand Carlow, that difficulty is being overcome; and \nwith a good supply of trained labour, the expansion of \nthe boot industry ought to· be comparatively easy in the \nfuture. • \nThere is no boot shop in Ireland that ought not to \nhave a stock of boots from one or more, if not all, the \nIrish boot factories. If a pmchaser goes into a shop \nand wishes to buy Irish boots on their merits, it is a \nshame that he is not given an opportunity to do so, and \nthe time has come when the consumers should again \nrouse themselves and do a hand's turn for Irish industry \nby talking to the shop-keepers for the shop-keepers' . \nown good. The boot manufacturers of Ireland. sell on \nmerits, and they deserve support on their merits; and \nit is very difficult for customers to give that support if \nshop after shop they go into have not a sufficient range \nof Irish-made boots in stock. \nThere is a busy go-a-head air about Carlow town that \nis in pleasant contrast to the tumble-clown appearance \nof too many other Irish towns. The \" beauty that \nhovers round decay \" is all very well in its way. The \nbeautiful and massive ruins of Carlow Castle stand in \nthe grounds of Mr. Michael Governey. But if he owns \nthe beautiful ruins of an ancient castle, he has founded \ntwo productive industries within reach of their shadows \nA HISTORY OF IRISH MUSIC.\" ' \nM \nR GRATI'AN FLOOD 'S \"History of Irish Music \" \nl has been received with a universal welcome, and I \ngiladly join m y voice in the general chorus of congratulation . \nTh e book is the work of a lifetime, the result of careful, \nprolonged, indefatig;i,ble research, and the amount of in­\nformation presented to the reader is, truly wonderful. \nBut while admitting frel'>ly the many merits of the book. \nthe critic must, as a duty, point otit some · draw-backs. \nTh ese are principally two-a want of style and a want· ·of \ncritical judgment. Under the first aspect the author can­\nnot be excused from a fair amount of carelessness. The· in­\nformation soom , sometimes to be thrown in simply in a \nheap, without any attempt at order. To give an example, \nwe get some infonnation about Ogham writing in two para­\ngraphs on pp. 2 and 3. In the next paragraph this subject \nis left, and afte,r learning something from MacFirbis' MS. \nBook of Genealogies and the Dinn Seanchils., we \"·come to \nthe close of tl1e third century, when we are on fairly solid \nhistorical ground.\" Immediately· we ai',e canied back,, in \nthe next paragraph, to the fifth century before Christ, and \nwe also learn something about the Galatians iri the time of \nSt. Jerome. Fina.Uy, a.ftar all these excursions, we come \nback to the subject of Ogham writing. I am glad to sa.y \nthat the later cha.pters of the book are more satisfactory, \nalthough here, too, information is sometimas thrown in \n\"aprop_os of \" sometl1ing. An annoying feature here, how-· \never, is the waste of valuable space by meaninglesi< repeti­\nt.ions. Thus, a sentence about a letter of Sir Henry Syd­\nney, given on p. 160, occurs verbatim again on n. 174. The \nconstitution of Queen Elizabeth's Band of Musick is given \nboth on p. 166 and p. 177. The object of the Charitable \nMusical Society is explained three times-pp. 266, 268, \nand 282. .And so on. \nMore serious, however, are the strictures I have to make \nunder. the second heading-want of critical judgment.

Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable.

MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

          "raw_text": "172 THE LEADER. MAY 6; 1905. \nTHE LEADER AND THE LEAGUE-. \nI \nT is puerile, if ·not worse, on the part of the \n. . majority of the Gaelic League Executive present \nat ~he late meeting, to deprecate controversy on the \nsubJect of the outrage on Procession Sunday, when they \n~ave themselves created a situation- very plainly put \n. 1n the first paragraph of your last issue- which is simply \nuntena.ble and cannot possibly be brooked by the more \nstrenuous ·and straightforward Revivalists in the pro­\nvinces. The Executive must tell us once for all and \nin unequivocal languaae whether th~y endorse o~· un­\nqu~lifi.edly • condemn, the outrage in questio~1. The \nEditor of the ~EADER is quite competent to fight his \nown corner agamst any honourable antagonist, but he \ncannot be expected to go about armed with a life pre­\nserver .or a revolver to defend himself against every \nblackguard, who, backed up by kindred spirits of the • \ncorner-boy -class, substitutes physical force for intel­\nlectual argument. \nI submit, therefore, that in the present juncture, there \nshould be a strong expression of opinion in condemna­\ntion of the outrage, and the unsatisfactory action ·,f \nthe Executive, from the numerous and influential body \nof Irish Irelanders throughout the country who look \nto the militant LEADER as the exnonent \n0f their views and the most efficient organ of \nthe great National Revival as distinguished from that \nbrnnch of it--the Language Movement . Vve are, all 0f \nus, deeply interested in the Langu age Movemen t, and \nhave given and taken hard knocks on its account; but \nwhen we wanted, through the medium of _the press, to \nfurther its interests-to encourage its friends or to pil-• \nlory its e.nemies-it w as never to the official organ but \nto the LEADER that we looked for a platform. \nWhen the. LEADER first saw the light, the Language \nMovement had not yet emerged from the Catacombs . \nI well remember I was passing through the metropolis \nabout the time. I had occasio·n to call on a distin­\nguished member of one of the great Regular Orders­\nhim~elf a well-known literary man, and now head of an \nimportant house abroad. He it was that directed my \nattention to the LEADER, the first number of which was \nthen on:· the eve of appearing. At the same time he \ninquired what progress, if any, the Gaelic League was \nma.king in my neighbourhood. Well, I must confess, I \nscarce knew wh _at he meant , so little was known -of the \nLeague in the provinces at the time. And , though I \nhad twice in my previous life-as a mere ·boy of four-· \nt-een and as a man-taken up the study of Irish-I \ncould not tell whether, at the period to which I am re­\nferring, the Language Movement had an official organ \nat all, it was still sunk in such obscurity. But the \nbold and fearless an_d ,practical propaganda preached by \ntli.e LEADER appealed to the stronger spirits in the \nprovinces-whose motto was the verb \" to do,\" not' the \nverb \"to say \"-and the Gaelic League was quickly \nbrought to the light of day. • Branches sprang up every­\nwh_ere. The presidency of one, at-a ve1;y important \ncentre, w~s thrust on myself., much against my wishes. \nHowever, I took off my coat to the work, and within a \nshort period had-with the assistance of a few ener-\n·getic co-workers-the teaching of Irish introduced ·into \nall ~he schools i~ the neighbourho?d, with, perhaps,· an \nattendance of fifteen hundred · children, or more ' • and \ninside of eighteen months or so I personally colle~ted a \nsum running well into three figure~ for the support of \nthe Movement. • \nBut it was not all plain sailing. Far from it. De­\ntermined opposition came from quarters, where a com­\nplete volte-face hafi since been executed. Faction \n' reared its head, as in every movement making for the \nbetterment of the· country, and in which the bold, bad, \nspiteful man has ever exercised a malign influence. The \nexecutive temporized then as now with the disturbing \nelement, and had it not been for the support accorded \nby the LEADER, we must have gone under for any help \nthat came from the official organ. And om· \ncase was only -typical of many anothe1· through­\nout the country. The Dublin daily Nationals \naave absolutely no help in those days. And \n;o far were the Gaelic League officials from repudiating \nthe LEAD ER then that on one occasion when, in the \nGaelic Leaaue office in O 'C onnell Street, I personally \nanimadvert~d on the weakness of the English side of the \nofficial organ, and its utter lack of assertiveness, I was \ntold that there was no occasion for development in th;i,t \ndirection, the LEADER covered the ground so effectively. \nH owe ver, since the daily Nationals, under the pressure \nof public opinion (created mainly by the LEADER) deemed \nit expedient, in the interest of their dividends, to es­\npouse the Language Movement , the metropolitan staff \nof the Leagu e came , I suppose, to the conclusion that \nthey could safely kick aw ay the ladder by which they \nclimbed to power. So now . led by the \"confrere\" \nstrutting, band-marsh all-like, in a Rober t Emmet uni­\nform , they wobble along, bolstered up by a National \ndaily on either side, and with the Irish 1'imes and the \nE xvress creeping stealthily in the rear, ever ready to \ndeliver a stab in the back, even though propitiated by \nan advertisement. Aud the LEADER , wh ich would be a. \ndisgrace, I suppose, in such select company , is boycotted. \nNow , it may be a good policy-from a M achiavelliarr \npoint of view -to curry favour in this w ay with our so­\ncalled N ational dailies and Tin-pike weekly, while \nignoring, when not insulting; the L EA DER, but it is verv \nbad principle, and mus t ultim ately re-act to the grave \ndetriment of the L anguage mo veme nt. \nAnd this jealousy of, if not enmi ty towards, the \nL EXDE R, has been developing itself for a long time in \nofficial quarters. I could give many instances, but one \nwill suffice. A friend of mine ,had by local action and \nsome articles in the LE ADER (the result of wide research) \nsucceeded in securing a concession or privileP-e for the \nLe~gue _in· the populous town in which he 1~sided, so \num que it was the only instance of the kind in all Ire­\nland ; and even Douglas Hyde could not believe it had \nbeen_ granted, more particularly as it had been refused \nto himself though backed up by all the machinery of \nthe movement. Well, will it be believed -that the offi­\ncial organ, though specially requested, declined to make \nthe m oclits 011era:11di by which this privilege was secured. \nki~own, through its columns; but, instead, furnished my \nfriend s address to inquirers in various parts· of the \ncountry, an~ he was for a long time afterwards \n?othered for_ rnformation w.hich might have been given \nIll the first mstance through the official organ, if the \nconductors were not too proud or too jealous to quote \nfrom and acknowledge indebtedness to the LEADER. \nIf _there was one characteristic more than another \n~hat m ~y own relations with the Gaelic Leao-ue Offic; \nm Dublm seemed to stand out prominently in the \nManagement ·there-whoever was responsible--it was a \nwant of c~urag~, coupled with vacillation and a tendency \nt~1~['1~01·ize. with, or fight shy of, difficulties, instead of \nY ackhng them as the LEADER has invariably done \nand so muc~ to its own advantage, too.

Perhaps later on I may be able to discuss \n• a. -few pc:>ints to show what is historica.Jly certain, what is \nproblematical, and what is altogether wrong. At pre.sent \nI can only mention a few things to prove that my criticism \nis deserved. I may refer; then, to some extraordinary state­\nments put ·forward without even a shadow of proof, such as \ntha.t the Og!uun writing was a musical notation, that \nNotlte1· .Bnlbulus was an Irishman, that the St. Gall glosses \n\" incontest-ably proved· tha.t pa.rt-singing was known to the \nIrish .'in the seventh century.\" Aga-in, Mr. Flood quotes \nfrom O 'Cu1-ry (p, viii.) :-\" Walke1· seems to have been tbe \nsport· of every pretender to antiquarian knowledge, but \n. more especially the dupe of an unscrupulous person of the \nname of-Beauford.\" And on p. 68 we ge_t some information \nabout the neums of the Irish. Now, what is the source of \nt-his information, If not \"an unscrupulous person of the \nname of Beauford \" ? \nUnder this seconcl aspect, too, the second half of the book \nis much better. Indeed, it is a veritable storehouse· of well­\na-uthenticated information. I have some misgivings, how­\never, about the attempts to date some of the Irish melodies. \nOn p. 121, for instance, the author assigns Scaghan O'D11ibhfr \n·<1-n Glcirn11a. to the last quarter of the sixteenth century. But \nthe re:isons he gives go only to show that the voem belongs to \n_ that date. They do not prove that the tune is not very much \nolder. It is similar with a. number of other melodies. ·There \nis some difficulty with regard to the air Tighcarna 111aighco, \np. 205. Here we have the direct testimony of Charles \nO'Conot· that the tune ·was composed by the harper, Thady \n-Keena.u. This is evidence that the historian cannot easily \nset aside. Still internal evidence i< very much against it. \nThe tune is strictly pentatonic-the b na.turail occurring twice \nin the usual setting is evidently interpolated. It 6eerns to \nme absolutely impossible that such an air could have been \n·composed at the end of the sev-enteenth century. I am \nstrongly inclined to date it back to pi·e-Christian times. The \ndifficuity, then, is to explain away O 'Conor's testimony. I \nthink, however, we might easiily suppose a misunderstanding. \nThadr Keenan may ha.ve said, \" That is my air,\" meaning \nthat he alone had the tradition of it, and that Da .vid O 'Mur­\nray got it from him, while Charles O 'Conor took it as meaning \nthat-Keenan had composed it. Anyhow the question de­\nserves discussion; \nIn connection with Seaglian O'D-ttibhir an Glcanna, Mr. \nFlood' remarks :-\" The very construction of the air seems \nto point to the second half ~f the -sixteenth century, rather \nthan the middle of the seventeenth century.\" It is very \nmuch to be regretted that he gives U6 no further light on this \nqttestion. · After all the Irish melodies are the ma-in item \nin the> subject of Irish music, and a history of Irish music \nought, therefore, in the ma-in to be a history of the Irish \nairs. But ahout that we have too lithle in Mr . Flood's book. \nPerhaps the time has not yet come for such a history. But \nany little light on tho subject would be mqst welcome·. \nI ninst end here. I have· thought it my duty to utter this \ncriticism on the book. But I repeat once more that t-he au­\nthor deserves great credit for h;ving given us such valuable \ninformation· as the ·book oonta.ins. Every Irishman who can \nafford t.o spend a. few shillings on Arb \">ught to buy n copy. \nThe -pn blishers, have done their· pa-rt exceLlehtly.

W11en it is cons1de;1'e~ -that \ntobacco, amounting in value to nearly a milhon of . \nmoney annually, is sold in th~s coul!'try,_ and that the \nwages bills alone of the factones wlnch would work UJ:> \nsuch a quantity of the weed-apart altogether-from _the \nplanting and curing-would exceed one l~undred _thou­\nsand a year, it may be surmised ~hat a_ big expen~ent \nwas at issue. Yet, as we have JUSt said, the Agricul­\ntural Department made no serious att_empt to arrive at \na conclusion whether it was worth wlule for the farmer \nto attempt the growth of the plant, or the manufacturer \nto· make it into a commercial article fit to smoke. .The \nDepartment dallied and dawdled,- and attempted the \nexperiment in anything but a con amore spirit. . . \nOf course, based as the present system of taxation 1s, \non a duty almost six times the value of the tobacco leaf \nin the cured but unmanufactured state, the Revenu~ . \nDepartments concerned with the collection of tl:ie duty \nnaturally should have a det~rmining voice in the regu­\nla.tions dealing with the growth of the plan,t until it \nbecame cured leaf fit for the manufacturer. Practia \ncally, however , the Inland Revenue authorities for the \npast five years, with a wonderful generosity, handed over \nto the Irish Agricultural Board the monopoly of grow­\nin~ the plant under very .easy conditions indeed. No \nother persons were allowed to· grow the crop until the \nsanction of Sir Horace Plunkett's Board was obtained. \nThey selected the persons and the places. It had to be \ngrown under their direction and the supervision of thefr _ \nexpert, and if any credit was to be gained, or. any \nfailure made, the Department, and the Department \nalone, was to be credited with the success ·or the failure \n6f the experiment,, as they alo~ie were g.i-ven the \nmonopoly. . \nThe Agricultural Depiutment had everything in-its \nfavour. In selecting its officers to conduct the experi­\nments it had the usual carte blanche which is given to \n11.ll Government Departments under such circumstances_ \nThrough the international courtesy which obtains be- . \ntween most' of the European and American natfons, the \nDepartment had the option of selecting the best ex­\nperts which money and a wealthy Government could \npurchase. As far as is know ,n, too, the Department \nwas not restricted in funds. It had the choice of the \nfour provinces in Ireland to select where the crop wo _uld \nbe grown. Further, it had the advantage-if its ex­\nperts _had take~ the trouble-to look up the matter, uf • \nknowmg the six or seven counties in Ireland where \ntobacco growing flourished_ and paid large profits some \nseve_nty years ago. Yet with •all these aids and advan­\ntages, U)ltil last y_ear, the tobacc? growing experiment \nwas a miserable failure, and certamly reflected no credit \non the D~partmeut under whose wing the experiment.s \nwere earned on. • \nIn the first three years of the experiment, the growino­\nof the crop was spread ovei: several counties, probabl; \nto test th~ nature of the s01l, rather than to learn tl1u. \nart of cun~g t_he crop grown. It was thought, after a \nthr~e.-years trial, the Department -would then be in ::i. \nposit10n to boast of a partial, if not a full, success in its \nfourth ye~r's experiment. Yet, judging the Depart­\nmen_t by its own report for that year, the crop was· \n?- miserable ?ne-a failure in-the plants grown, a failure-\n11;1 the seedhng plants. imported from France, at a co1i-. \ns1derable cost; and a still more miserable failure in the. \naUempt_ to cnre th~ crop that did grow. Instead \nof makmg progress it was the other way round.",

In th~ mineral water and h_op bitter industries \nMr. Governey gives employment to no less than 60 or 70 \nhands i~ the summer months, and every one of these \nbegan as boy·s in his place. Mr. Governey .manufac­\nt~res a proportion of the corks he uses, and he builds \nhis OiWn vans--and he has 21 vans on the road. It is \nevident that he is not anxious to buy anything that \nhe Cil,n produce, a disposition that it would be well for \nthe country were it more prevalent. The business mind \n-of Ireland is now, happily, turning towards productive \nindustries, and thoug4 the material results, so far, \nmay not be great, yet they are many and considerable \nAbout two years ago, some priests and people in Carlow \nivere an.-.::ious that something new should be attempted \nin the industrial world, and there was a public meeting \n·.caJled. A bacon factory was suggested; but eventually \na boot .factory found most favour. Mr. Governey had \nan interview with Mr. T'. P. Gill and an expert was sent \n<down. There were thr!3e ways of attempting to start \nth~ .. :hoot factory. One was on the co-operative plan, \n.an9ther was by means of a public comp any, and· the \nthird was by starting it as a one-man concern. For­\ntunately, Mr .Governey was prepared to take the risk \n.all on his own shoulders, and so the site of an old ruin \nis now covered by a modern , well-equipped and compact \nfactory. The problem of production was a difficult one. \nFor the task that Mr. Michael Governey, an extensive \nmineral water manufacturer, took upon himself was to \n-start a boot factory, though he possessed no practical \n-experience in that line-and more than that, start it \nin a town in which the industry was previously un­\nknown. He first had to procure the services of some \npeople from the boot manufacturing centres of England, \n.and then the training of the native workers commenced . \nAnyone who has had any experience in the trials and \n• troubles of starting a new industry can readily apprP-­\n•ciate the difficulty of Mr . Governey 's task. Last \n'Thursday week we were over the factory. About 45 \nCarlow hands are now employed there, in addition lo \n.the few fully experienced hands whom Mr . Governey \n.brought over to teach the industry. As this is not a. \n. technical journal, any detailed reference to technical \nprocesses would be out of place. Needless to say the \nprinciple of the division of labour is largely availed of, \n·.and the employees work at various ingenious machines. \nThe girls work at a great table in· a room to them­\nselves. The appearance of the place was thoroughly \nbusiness like, and it was pleasant to watch young, newly \ntr~ined hands pushing on with their special division of \n. the now much divided operation of turning out a \n• machine-made boot. Nothing but leather is used, and \nMr. ··Governey 1s of course anxious to use as much Irish \ntanned leather as possible on business principles. Mr . \n,Governey, a keen business man as well as an Irishman \n,of public spirit, has now solved the problem of pr~­\n<lucing machine-made boots in a town where no suc11 \n. industry before existed. It is now for the common \nsense Irish public to lend a hand to help in the problem \nof disti·ibution. Mr. Governey asks no customer of \nhis to: sacrifice as much as a ha'penny in the way of \n.bolstering up Carlow-made boots. He sells as a busi­\n;ness man, and claini.s that his boots can be sold by the \n:retailer at competitive prices on the open market. \n. 'The fact that one of the great English distributing .firms \n'ithat have many branches in Ireland, are large pur­\nchasers of his boots, indicates their power to stand \nthe test of competition. Up to this, ladies and chil­\ndren's. boots have been practically the sole. out-put of \nthe, factory. Attention is now being given to men's \nlboots. For our part, though we aFe not experts, the \n·boots that we saw appeared to us as exceptional value \nat the prices at which they could be sold by retail \nfirms. The output at present is, we believe, about 500 \npairs weekly; within a reasonable time it· could be in­\n.creased to 1,500 pairs weekly, and after that-well, \nCarlow has plenty of room for extended factories, and \nMr. Michael Governey is an enterprising man . \nThere is plenty of room for a dozen, an:d many a \ndozen, more boot factories in Ireland. A new boot fac­\ntory is a benefit to existing factories. We remember \nover four years ago, when we were looking for informa­\ntion for our \".Nation Building '' article on boots, we \nheard much at Winstanley's great factory in Dublin, \nabout the inconveniences of the lack of an adequate \nIrish labour market in the boot industry. Now with \nthriving factories in Waterford, Cork, Belfast, Dublin \nand Carlow, that difficulty is being overcome; and \nwith a good supply of trained labour, the expansion of \nthe boot industry ought to· be comparatively easy in the \nfuture. • \nThere is no boot shop in Ireland that ought not to \nhave a stock of boots from one or more, if not all, the \nIrish boot factories. If a pmchaser goes into a shop \nand wishes to buy Irish boots on their merits, it is a \nshame that he is not given an opportunity to do so, and \nthe time has come when the consumers should again \nrouse themselves and do a hand's turn for Irish industry \nby talking to the shop-keepers for the shop-keepers' . \nown good. The boot manufacturers of Ireland. sell on \nmerits, and they deserve support on their merits; and \nit is very difficult for customers to give that support if \nshop after shop they go into have not a sufficient range \nof Irish-made boots in stock. \nThere is a busy go-a-head air about Carlow town that \nis in pleasant contrast to the tumble-clown appearance \nof too many other Irish towns. The \" beauty that \nhovers round decay \" is all very well in its way. The \nbeautiful and massive ruins of Carlow Castle stand in \nthe grounds of Mr. Michael Governey. But if he owns \nthe beautiful ruins of an ancient castle, he has founded \ntwo productive industries within reach of their shadows \nA HISTORY OF IRISH MUSIC.\" ' \nM \nR GRATI'AN FLOOD 'S \"History of Irish Music \" \nl has been received with a universal welcome, and I \ngiladly join m y voice in the general chorus of congratulation . \nTh e book is the work of a lifetime, the result of careful, \nprolonged, indefatig;i,ble research, and the amount of in­\nformation presented to the reader is, truly wonderful. \nBut while admitting frel'>ly the many merits of the book. \nthe critic must, as a duty, point otit some · draw-backs. \nTh ese are principally two-a want of style and a want· ·of \ncritical judgment. Under the first aspect the author can­\nnot be excused from a fair amount of carelessness. The· in­\nformation soom , sometimes to be thrown in simply in a \nheap, without any attempt at order. To give an example, \nwe get some infonnation about Ogham writing in two para­\ngraphs on pp. 2 and 3. In the next paragraph this subject \nis left, and afte,r learning something from MacFirbis' MS. \nBook of Genealogies and the Dinn Seanchils., we \"·come to \nthe close of tl1e third century, when we are on fairly solid \nhistorical ground.\" Immediately· we ai',e canied back,, in \nthe next paragraph, to the fifth century before Christ, and \nwe also learn something about the Galatians iri the time of \nSt. Jerome. Fina.Uy, a.ftar all these excursions, we come \nback to the subject of Ogham writing. I am glad to sa.y \nthat the later cha.pters of the book are more satisfactory, \nalthough here, too, information is sometimas thrown in \n\"aprop_os of \" sometl1ing. An annoying feature here, how-· \never, is the waste of valuable space by meaninglesi< repeti­\nt.ions. Thus, a sentence about a letter of Sir Henry Syd­\nney, given on p. 160, occurs verbatim again on n. 174. The \nconstitution of Queen Elizabeth's Band of Musick is given \nboth on p. 166 and p. 177. The object of the Charitable \nMusical Society is explained three times-pp. 266, 268, \nand 282. .And so on. \nMore serious, however, are the strictures I have to make \nunder. the second heading-want of critical judgment.

The statement \nfinished with a profound declaration that 'the Irish Government are \ndetermined to take every necessary step to stamp out this German Plot'. \nOn the basis of this spurious claim, most of the leadership of the \nVolunteers and Sinn Fein were arrested on 17 and 18 of May. Among \nthose that were arrested were Eamon de Valera, Countess Markievicz, \nArthur Griffith, Darrell Figgis, Joseph McGuinness, Joseph McGrath \nand William T Cosgrave. In total 73 leading members of Sinn Fein and \nthe Volunteer Movement were arrested. The Limerick Chronicle of 31 \nMay 1918 records that police under Sergeant McCarthy raided the City \nPrinting Works in Rutland Street in search of 'material relative to the \nalleged German Plot'. Nothing of an incriminating matter was found but \nthe raid seemed to reflect the manner in which the authorities seemed to \nbe clutching at straws to justify their course of action. \nAs the impact of the arrests began to take effect the public perception \nin Ireland began to see the moves by the authorities as a cynical if clumsy \nattempt to remove the leadership of Sinn Fein and the Republican \nMovement. The ultimate losers were going to be the Irish Nationalist Party \nand as the summer of 1918 unfolded a number of them began to realise \nthis. The ham-fisted policies of the British Authorities, in Ireland, were \n195 T p C 1m at oogan,De Valera-Long Fellow, Long Shadow, (London 1993) p.110 \nRe-organisation, Dissension and the Threat of Conscription 1917-1918 185 \ngoing to make it more and more difficult for them in any future electoral \ncontest with Sinn Fein. In August 1918 a number of them took issue \nwith Mr Shortt in the House of Commons. Joe Devlin, the Nationalist \nMP for West Belfast, and one of the few Nationalist Party MPs who \nwas still in touch with his electorate, declared that the 'German Plot was \nthe outcome of the imagination of the Chief Secretary'. In the course \nof his speech Devlin declared that he believed that the administration \nwas trying to solve the Irish Qyestion by getting rid of the 'present Irish \nrepresentatives'. Devlin prophetically reminded the house that 'something \nmore than speech might be expected from their successors'.196 \n196 Limerick Leader Files October 1918",

This decision was influenced by what \nthey believed was a move for change occasioned by the response to the \nexecutions of 1916. The intervention of Edward Thomas O'Dwyer the \nCatholic Bishop of Limerick had given a respectability to Republican \naspirations that it might not otherwise have had. \nThe candidate chosen to represent Sinn Fein, Count George Plunkett, \nwas the 66-year-old father of one of the executed signatories of the \n1916 procla111ation. The Roscommon By-election provided a brilliant \nfocus and platform for the Sinn Fein organisation just as many of its \nmost prominent members were emerging from internment. In the \nevent Plunkett was victorious by 3,022 votes to Devine's 1708 votes \nwith Tully tailed off in third place with 687 votes. By any measure it was \na resounding victory and it proved to be the shot in the arm that the \nRepublicajn Movement and Sinn Fein was seeking. Patrick O'Connell \nof Foynes gives a very interesting insight into the impact of Plunkett's \nvictory in the west Limerick area. A huge bonfire was lit in Foynes \nvillage and the Sinn Fein supporters celebrated by singing nationalist \nsongs well into the night. Eleven men were arrested and charged with \n'lighting and making use of a fire in the neighbourhood of Foynes \nwithout permission of the competent Naval or Military authority'. The \nFoynes men were taken to Limerick for trial and it appears that their \narrival in the city, on 22 March, was the occasion for a demonstration by \nnumbers of young men from the city outside William Street Barracks. \nTen of the men from Foynes were charged and were bound to the peace \nbut one man Patrick Jackson was sentenced to one month in Jail. As \nalways the Police authorities had succeeded in making heroes through \ntheir shortsightedness because Jackson emerged one month later to a \nwelcome fit for a hero.198 On the morning of Thursday 25 April, the \nauthorities exacted retribution on the young men who demonstrated \nin William Street and 18 of them were arrested at their homes in the \nearly hours of that morning.

His solicitor was Mr Hugh O'Brien-Moran and \nin the course of his defence of James Ryan, O'Brien-Moran quoted \nfrom some documents which were considered confidential by the police \nauthorities.200 The documents that he quoted from stated that the RIC \nwere instructed to pay for admission to matches, if requested to do so. 201 \nWhile O'Brien-Moran was technically correct the fact was that he was \nquoting from documents that he was not entitled to be in possession of. \nAs a consequence O'Brien-Moran found himself charged with being in \npossession of confidential documents and of failing to reveal how he came \nto be in possession of these documents. He was also tried by court-martial \nat Richmond Barracks in Dublin in January 1917 and, despite a very \nable defence, mounted by Tim Healy and John Power, Hugh O'Brien-\n199 Weekly Observer 28 April 1917 \n200 Hugh O'Brien-Moran (1886-1950) was a son of James Hishon Moran a Solicitor with \nstrong nationalist credentials.James H Moran had himself been jailed during the Land \nWar for making a seditious speech at Ballyneety in 1889. The older Moran was a close \nfriend of William O'Brien, who was unmarried and stood as Godfather to Moran's son, \nhence the O'Brien which was used as a form of Christian name.

It was actions such as these, where it was felt that ordinary \nRIC men had acted with unwarranted arrogance that contributed to the \nostracisation of the police and their families as much as any politically \nmotivated actions.202 When O'Brien-Moran's arrived back in Limerick \non 23 March, he was accorded a very enthusiastic welcome by a large \ncrowd. Indeed a demonstration against the police by some of the crowd \nlater led to fu;ther court charges. 203 \nOn 9 May 1917 Sinn Fein contested a by-election in Longford South. As \nwas the case in Roscommon Longford South had been an uncontested \nconstituency since 1892 and effectively whilst the ordinary people of \nIreland might have gained the vote in 1884 204 they rarely got a chance \nto exercise it because the Nationalist Party candidate was rarely \nchallenged. The Nationalist Party candidate was a man named Patrick \nMcKenna and Sinn Fein had nominated Joseph McGuinness who \nwas at that stage serving time in prison. The slogan that the Sinn Fein \norganisers used was one of 'Put him in - to get him out'. The slogan \nseemed to catch on and it galvanised McGuinness's campaign. In the \nevent Sinn Fein won the election by the very narrow margin of 32 \nvotes. On the evening that the election result was announced there \nwere widespread celebrations throughout the country. In Ballylanders \nthe Volunteers used the occasion to have a full-scale mobilisation \nof the local company and some of the other neighbouring volunteer \ncompanies.

          "raw_text": "226 1he Uar of Independence in Limerick \nto establish if Hogan was on the train and where he was located. They \nwould signal this information to Treacy when they arrived at Knock.long. \nHogan meanwhile had been placed on the evening train at Thurles \nrailway station. His escort consisted of a sergeant and three constables. \nSergeant Peter Wallace, who had been in charge of the raiding party that \ncaptured Hogan at Annfield on Monday morning, was in charge of the \nescort. Constables Jeremiah Ring and John O'Reilly had also been part \nof the raiding party at Annfield. The fourth member of the escort was \nConstable Michael Enright, a native ofLickadoon near Ballyneety, who \nhad been on leave in Limerick over the week-end and had just returned \nto duty on Monday morning. Enright was the only one of the escort \nactually stationed at Thurles. The other three were based at Roskeen \nalthough O'Reilly and Ring were only on temporary secondment on \naccount of the imposition of Martial Law. Hogan and his escort were \nsituated in the first carriage in a compartment backing on to the engine. \nHogan was seated with his back to the engine with Michael Enright on \nhis inside and Sergeant Wallace on the outside close to the door. Ring \nand O'Reilly sat on the opposite seat with their rifles in the upright \nposition. Wallace and Enright had revolvers drawn. \nWhen the unarmed Galbally men had gone to Emly Treacy broke \nhis own party into two groups to avoid attracting attention. Breen and \nRobinson cycled together to Knock.long. Their responsibility being to \ncover the exit and to ensure that the train did not pull out until a rescue \nwas completed. Treacy and Ned O'Brien, both armed with revolvers \nwere to constitute the main rescue party. To add a further complication \nto Treacy's plan they could not predict the exact time of arrival of the \nupward evening train from Cork to Dublin. Sometimes the two trains \nmet at Knock.long and sometimes the Dublin train arrived before the \nCork train. Neither could they predict if there would be armed police \nor military on either train. As it transpired the Cork train arrived in \nstation and departed from Knock.long just as the Dublin train arrived. \nA party of police from Galbally had alighted from the Cork train and \nmade their way from the station. Fortunately for Treacy's plans they \nwere well on the road to Galbally when the Dublin train arrived. It \n1he Rescue at Knocklong and its Aftermath 227 \nwas 7.45 pm,when Treacy and O'Brien arrived in Knock.long. They had \nspotted the Galbally RIC and stayed out of their way as they waited for \nthe Dublin train. They still had 20 minutes to while away and Treacy \nsent O'Brien in search ofThomas Shanahan, to see if any telegrams had \nbeen received. As it transpired Shanahan had received a telegram from \nMay Moloney, but as he had not been appraised by Davy Burke, the \ntelegram mystified him as it also happened, by coincidence, to overlap \nwith his ctwn private dealings in greyhounds. He handed over the \ntelegram that read 'greyhound in Thurles still'. This meant that Hogan \nwas not on the train. \nBy the time O'Brien got back to the station Shanahan arrived with a \nfresh telegram but at that stage the Dublin train could be seen coming \ndown the line. When the train arrived in the station John Joe O'Brien \njumped on to the platform and pointed out, to his brother and Treacy, \nthe carriage and compartment that Hogan and his escort were in.262 \nTreacy then drew his revolver and followed by O'Brien and the unarmed \nGalbally men they entered the carriage. When they threw open the door \nof the compartment the police were taken completely by surprise and it \nlooked for a second as if the rescue would be bloodless. Enright, who was \nseated inside Hogan, appeared to menace the prisoner with his revolver \nand both Treacy and O'Brien fired simultaneously. Michael Enright, a \n35-year-old, single man, dropped dead as he was shot through the heart. \nThis has often been a point of contention that the IRA men opened fire \nwithout reason but the statement of District Inspector McLean, who \ninvestigated the case, stated that Enright sought to 'restrain Hogan'. \nIt was admitted, in the same statement, that when challenged to put \nhis hands up Sergeant Wallace replied 'not likely'.263 Following the \nshooting a tremendous struggle ensued between Sergeant Wallace and \nSean Treacy for possession of the sergeant's service revolver because \nTreacy had lost his own at the start of the fracas. \nThe efforts of others to get involved or to give assistance were \nconstrained by the lack of space in the compartment and the corridor \n262 W/S 1647 Witness Statement ofJohn Joe O'Brien (Bureau of Military History) p.9 \n263 County 904/41 (British National Archives, Kew)",
