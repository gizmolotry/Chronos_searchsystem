A considerable number of the \nadolescent and adult population not only of Mun~ter, \nbut of all Ireland are to-day cursed by an unearthly \ncraving for alcoholic spirits. This craving is so insati­\nable, so destructive to th€) spiritual and temporal wel­\nfare, not only of the individual, but of those \nwithin the sphere of his influence, that it may be justly \ntermed the \" Drink Demon .\" This Demon- ravages at \n. one and the same time the towns and cities, the vil­\nlages and cottages of the land. The millions of pounds \nto \\;vhich the national drink bill annually amounts is \nonly a small fraction of the .sum total of the tribute he \nexacts. Who can reduce to money the loss sustained \nwhen so many thousands of human souls are turned \naway from the paths of innocence and virtue and \nsunk into the hopeless depths of vice; when so many \na.dults have their constitution undermined and transmit \n'incurable diseases to future generations; when thou­\nsands of the young and gifted of our race have their pros­\npects in life blighted; when such vast areas of our cities \nand large towns become \" power-houses \" of moral and \nphysical disease; when the. homes of so maµy toilers be­\ncome little better than hells on earth? Who can esti­\nmate the loss in ruined character, in disappointed hope, \nin neglected duty, in blighted ambition to the in-\n. dividual and . the race? Who can estimate all this and \nreduce it to pounds sterling of the realm:? Woe to \nthat realm whose security for such a large part of its \nrevenue consists in the permanent hold the Drink \nDemon has on the minds -and bodies of the people. \nThe ravages of this Demon are so vast and are increas­\ning at such a rate ~hat, did I not believe we have suffi­\nqient national grit left in us to apply a remedy, I \nshould fprthwith despair of my country ..

In the story \nthe Demon admits that it was through the intercession \nof '' that little fair woman from the Curtagh '' by \n.which is meant St. Bridget, that he -loosed his hold \nof Catha!. So, too, at the present day. The power of \nprayer, influence of religion and of moral restraint must \nform part of the cure. \nTotal Abstinence Leagues, Temperance Sodalities, and \nsuch like institutions will not, no doubt, effect ?f \nthemselves a complete national exorcism, but_ they will \nkeep the high and savi~g ideal of self-restramt ~efore \nthe minds of the people. In the ·story, Catha! did. not \nfast alone, MacConglinne and the entire househ?ld \nfasted with him . So, too, the exorcism of the na~ion \nfrom the drink demon can never be effected until a \nlarge and influential portion of the population consent \nit·ithoitt cmy versonal neccssifAJ to observe the fast of \ntotal abstinence in conjunction with, and as an encour­\nagement to their afflicted fellow-countryme~. The mo~·e \ninfluential and exalted, the more perseve~,ng and self­\nsacrincing these voluntary fasters fro~ drmk, the more \nspeedy and effective will be the national c1;11:e. The \nclergy and religious communities should be m the v?'n \nof this great national expiatory movement, but the vi~·­\ntuous, high-m1nded and enlightened laity who love t~en· \ncountry should not be far behind. The humblest toiler \nin the land has his own place in this great army of a \nnation's regenerators. To me it is as clear as no~n-day \nthat a national exorcism can never be effected without \nan earnest, widespread, persevering movement of total \nabstinence. But more than this is necessary. In the \nstory, Cathal is bound hand and foot and kept fr?m \nfood in the-final stages of the cure. So, too, the Drm~ \nDemon can never be expelled until the drunkard is \nrestrained by . prudent, salutary, rigidly enforc_ed le~is­\nlation.

The king is now removed toan adjo\"in­\nmg house, and the house in which this scene ·bas been \nena:cted _is· cleared of all its furniture except the pot \nwhich,still covers the Demon. This house is now set on \nfire, -and the Demon is seen to rise above the flames, and \nere 'he departs for ·ever 'from ·amon-g·st • them he ·pro­\nnounces a eulogium ·on MacConglinne. \n'·' Thus,\" says the shorter version, \" was Catha! \nMacF~nguine cured from his craving and MacConglinne \nhonoured:\" This story, of which I have only given· a \nbare outline, and which is delightfully told in Father \nO'Leary's book, may well induce us to reflect on the \nravages being made by the Demon of Drink amongst ·us \nat the present day. A considerable number of the \nadolescent and adult population not only of Mun~ter, \nbut of all Ireland are to-day cursed by an unearthly \ncraving for alcoholic spirits. This craving is so insati­\nable, so destructive to th€) spiritual and temporal wel­\nfare, not only of the individual, but of those \nwithin the sphere of his influence, that it may be justly \ntermed the \" Drink Demon .\" This Demon- ravages at \n. one and the same time the towns and cities, the vil­\nlages and cottages of the land. The millions of pounds \nto \\;vhich the national drink bill annually amounts is \nonly a small fraction of the .sum total of the tribute he \nexacts. Who can reduce to money the loss sustained \nwhen so many thousands of human souls are turned \naway from the paths of innocence and virtue and \nsunk into the hopeless depths of vice; when so many \na.dults have their constitution undermined and transmit \n'incurable diseases to future generations; when thou­\nsands of the young and gifted of our race have their pros­\npects in life blighted; when such vast areas of our cities \nand large towns become \" power-houses \" of moral and \nphysical disease; when the. homes of so maµy toilers be­\ncome little better than hells on earth? Who can esti­\nmate the loss in ruined character, in disappointed hope, \nin neglected duty, in blighted ambition to the in-\n. dividual and . the race? Who can estimate all this and \nreduce it to pounds sterling of the realm:? Woe to \nthat realm whose security for such a large part of its \nrevenue consists in the permanent hold the Drink \nDemon has on the minds -and bodies of the people. \nThe ravages of this Demon are so vast and are increas­\ning at such a rate ~hat, did I not believe we have suffi­\nqient national grit left in us to apply a remedy, I \nshould fprthwith despair of my country .. But I de­\ncline to believe that the evil is incurable. In the story \nthe Demon admits that it was through the intercession \nof '' that little fair woman from the Curtagh '' by \n.which is meant St. Bridget, that he -loosed his hold \nof Catha!. So, too, at the present day. The power of \nprayer, influence of religion and of moral restraint must \nform part of the cure. \nTotal Abstinence Leagues, Temperance Sodalities, and \nsuch like institutions will not, no doubt, effect ?f \nthemselves a complete national exorcism, but_ they will \nkeep the high and savi~g ideal of self-restramt ~efore \nthe minds of the people. In the ·story, Catha! did. not \nfast alone, MacConglinne and the entire househ?ld \nfasted with him . So, too, the exorcism of the na~ion \nfrom the drink demon can never be effected until a \nlarge and influential portion of the population consent \nit·ithoitt cmy versonal neccssifAJ to observe the fast of \ntotal abstinence in conjunction with, and as an encour­\nagement to their afflicted fellow-countryme~. The mo~·e \ninfluential and exalted, the more perseve~,ng and self­\nsacrincing these voluntary fasters fro~ drmk, the more \nspeedy and effective will be the national c1;11:e. The \nclergy and religious communities should be m the v?'n \nof this great national expiatory movement, but the vi~·­\ntuous, high-m1nded and enlightened laity who love t~en· \ncountry should not be far behind. The humblest toiler \nin the land has his own place in this great army of a \nnation's regenerators. To me it is as clear as no~n-day \nthat a national exorcism can never be effected without \nan earnest, widespread, persevering movement of total \nabstinence. But more than this is necessary. In the \nstory, Cathal is bound hand and foot and kept fr?m \nfood in the-final stages of the cure. So, too, the Drm~ \nDemon can never be expelled until the drunkard is \nrestrained by . prudent, salutary, rigidly enforc_ed le~is­\nlation. The evil has gone too far to be remedie~ with­\nout _strong legislative action. To come ·to particulars, \nthe laws that govern clubs are a scandal to .the ?ountry, \nand their administration is a greater scandal still.

In this way national interests are too \nfrequ_1-mtly subordinated to personal.

Vve have heard too much­\nfrom persons of no c01isequence-of the number of Pro­\ntesta~ts who are likely to be estranged from the Revival, \nMov(;lment by the tone of the LEADER. Now, I have·no \nfears on this score in regard to men of the John Martfo \nor Mitchell or Douglas Hyde stamp, whose co-operation \nis worth having, and for whom we have never been want ­\ning in respect and gratitude. Rather-and I speak with \nlion experience of every part of the kingdom, and even \nof the home life of those differing from us in the faith­\nther.e is grave danger that in endeavouring, grati­\ntuously, to propitiate our separated brethren, we shall, \nb7 modifying our views and paring down our prin­\nciples, lose ten times more than we are likely to gain. \nToo _many of these people, I am sorry to say, either \nhate or despise us, while the bulk of the best of them­\npatronizingly self-sufficient men of the Horace Plunkett \nstamp-,-have less respect for the prejudices and suscep­\ntibilities of the Irish Papist than they would in similar \ncircumstances have for those of the Mohammedan fel­\nlah of Egypt, or the Hindu of India. \n\" DESMOND. \" \nTHE DEMON OF INTEMPERANCE. <,! \nT\nHE \"Vision of MacConglinne,\" of which the \nbook I am reviewing is a version in· modern \nIrish, by Jrather Peter O'Leary, is a unique wonder ­\ntale in Middle Irish, of which two versions are extant. \nA long and elaborate version is given in the Leabhar \nBreac, a manuscript of the fourteenth century, and a \nshorter versidn occurs in a MS. preserved in T.C.D. \nLibrary, (H, 3, 18). Both these versions have been \nedited and translated by Dr. K. Meyer, and are now \nsome fifteen years before the public. Father O'Leary's \nversion follows mainly the longer or Leabhar Breac nar­\nrative, though he introduces some particulars from the \nshorter account. His version is not a close moderni­\nzation of the old tale, departing as it does from it in \nmany particulars; nevertheless, it hangs together quite \nconsistently, and is extremely readable. The style is \nmasculine and unconventional and the interest well \nsustaine~; the actual \" Vision \" being perhaps the \nleast interesting part of the book. The story relates \nhow Catha!' MacFinguine, king of Munster, who was \npossessed by the Demon of Gluttony, was cured by Mac­\nConglinne, a distinguished scholar from Leath Chuinn . \n. ThEt Demon of Gluttony got entrance into Cathal in this \nway :-Catha.I was in love with Ligach, daughter of \nMaeldun, king of Aileach in the North, and she re­\nturned his affection, though neither had seen the other. \nTei prove the sincerity of her attachment; she used to \nsend presents of apples, kernels and sweetmeats to \nCatha!. When her brother Fergal was informed of \nthis he sent for her and asked her to declare the truth. \nFearing his curse she did so. ·He then directed her to \nsend the_ next present through himself to Catha!. This \nshe did. But Feargal, through the instrumentality of \na \"fe-'1' p1reo5,'' put charms and spells on the viands \na.nd despatched them to Catha!, giving orders to his \nmesseno-ers to entreat the Munster king in the most \nsolemn °manner to eat them at once. Catha! did ·accord­\ningly, and from these charmed viands arose the Demon \n\" .i.n C11'-'or--oe\"m\"\"n. 4n t:4i:4111 pe\"-o\"'t' U4 l...105\"'t'e -oo \n·rc11io?I.

The voradty of ~he king, \nowing to the promptings of this exacting tenant pass~s \nall description. To quote from the old tale-\" A pig \nand a cow and a bull calf of three· hands, with three \nscore cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, and \nthirty heatb-poults' eggs, that was his first dole, be­\nsides his other snack, until his great feast was ready for \nhim. As regards the great feast that passes account or \nreckoning.\" It is obvious that Oathal was an un­\nwelcome guest among bis subjects. For three half­\nyears did he ravage Munster devouring all that could \nbe placed before him. His annual visitation of his \nkingdom was as exhaustive of the resources of the \ncountry as the march 'of a conquering army. \nGredimtts altos \nD ef ec-isse a nines epotctl]'lte fl·umiina, tlf cclo \nPranclente, et madiclis cam,tat qure Sostmtis ·alis. \nSuch was the evil that MacConglinne undertook to \ncure, \" having been sent by God and the Lord,\" accord­\ning to the Leabbar Breac version, \" for the salvation of \nCatha! MacFinguine and the men of Munster, and the· \nwhole Southern half to boot.\" MacConglinne begins by \npicking a quarrel with the monks of Cork and their \nAbbot , Manchin . The details of this quarrel are no \nvery pleasant reading, but are considerably softened \ndown in Father O'Leary's version. He complains of ill­\ntreatment in the guest-house of the monks, and extem­\nporises some satirical verses at which the )...bbot takes \numbrage . He is sentenced to be executed, but escapes \nhis doom in the hope tha.t a vision which he has related \nbefore the assembled nobles of Cork would, if recited \nbefore Oathal, cure him of his devouring greed. Mac­\nConglinne sets out for the house of Pichan, where the \nking is to be entertained at night. At dinner, by an \n· artifice, he attracts the notice of the king, on whom he \nprevails to fast that night in order to free him from the \nmalediction pronounced against him by the monks of \nCork. It was a great favour from one torn internally \nby the Demon of Gluttony. But MacConglinne wanted \nmore. He prevailed qn Catha! to prolong his fast, and \nwhen the lengthened fast had weakened him beyond the \npower of resistance he had him securely bound. As \nCatha! lay thus unable to move hand or foot, MacCon ­\nglinne began to recite his Vision in his ear, pausing every \nnow and then to present a morsel of the most savoury \nmeat to the king's lips, and withdrawing it again after \na tantalising fashion. The continuous repetition of this. \nprocess was more than the Demon of Gluttony within \nthe king could stand. Accordingly, as the recitation of \nthe Vision-draws to a close_. when MacConglinne pre­\nsents a delicio·us morsel to the king's lips, the Demon, \nfearing a recurrence of his disappointment, jumps forth \nfrom the king's mouth in the s4ape of a newt, fas­\ntens with l11s claws and mouth on the morsel, and seeks \na:~}:,r 1';i~1,\"~~~t4~.;.ll!, -~~:u.1~~PTTBr:J~ ':~t .. -~ \n--t tli• hdutrh,1 ltnhal \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \n__,.__._ ....... : .. : ............... \nWe nrc nctu1LI mnnufacturera of every ki'nd \nof Ir:ah Art ,Tcwellcry, which we produoo in \nour own workshops on the preniisu. \nWe spceinlfse the making of t-bc following \nwell-known and beautiful brooobea :-\nThe Tur1L, Tore, D\"llindcrr:r, Fibub.c, Innis. \nbowen, Kilkenny, etc., nny of which can be \nhnd in cit.her gold or siher. \nMedals nnd badges, our own original de• \noigns, ma.nufaotured at lowest prices. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdltrs, snuusmltbs, \nWatcb a\"'I Clockmaktrs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nO,iposito v-::onnell Monume:it, DUBLIN.",

In the course of her letter she expresses \nh~r indignation that the Executive of the League \" with­\nheld the apology due to you for the insult offered in the \nLanguage Procession.\" And she adds-\" I take this \nopportunity of expressing my disapproval, and that. of \nmy sons· (oath Gaelic Leaguers), for the shameful occur­\nrence.'' \nWe have received 10s. for the Language Fund from \nan anonymous correspondellt in London, who signs him­\nself Seom111 ce.

He addressed \nthem in Irish. Six or seven days afterwards, the loca~ \nPostmaster asked Mr. Nono to call upon him, and at the \ninterview that followed the Ennis Postmaster stated that \nhe was instructed to give Mr. Nono an opportunity of \nadding the addresses in English. Mr. Nono declined to \nadd the aadresses in English. . The Ennis Postmaster il!. \na Mr. Plummer . This Mr . Plummer went on a holiday \nat E aster. No less than 200 letters addressed in Irish \nwere posted on the Satw·day night, and as Plummer was \nnot at his post 199 of them were sent -thro-qgh without· \ndelay- one-solitary letter of the 200 being 24 hours be­\nhind time. \nA few days ago Mr . Nono received the following offi­\ncial reply from the G.P .O ., London:-\" Sir-In reply \nto your letter of the 14th instant, I am directed by the \nPostmaster-General to inform you that no member of \nthe staff at the Ermis Post Office understands Irish, ~p.d \nin order, as far as possible, to prevent d~lay in the dis­\nposal of the 42 halfpenny, packets in question addressed \nin that language, it was thought right to give you au \nopportunity of furnishing translations of the addresses . \nAs , however, you declined to do this, the packets were \nsent in ordinary course to Dublin.

Evans and Co ., of \nLimerick, and Messrs. Burmeister & Wain, of Dublin, \nhad extensive displays. The only representative of \nthe Woollen industry th~t, as far as we noticed,. had a \nstand at the show was the Providence Mills, Foxford. \nThose connected with the Bee industry found plenty to \ninterest them at the stand of Messrs. Edmondson Bros., \nof Dame Street, Dublin.

His scheme is an ad, interim one. Dr . \nConnor Maguire suggests a full-blown scheme providing \nan income of £20,000 or £30,000. At 3 per· cent. \n£1,000,000 would produce £30,000 a....year.

There is no great security in annual collec­\ntions. The twenty or so millions of the Irish race at \nhome and abroad that we so often bear of could raise a \ncapital of a million by subscribing a shilling a bead. \nThe appeal for a capital sum would--0r anyway should \n-have a great effect on the wealthy Irish-Americans. \nIrish-Americans stand considerably to gain in many \nways by the moral and intellectual upraising of the \nmothe; race at home. There is besides a psychologicr-\\ \nforce 1n a fine wholesale demand that is altogether ab• \n11ent from a very moderate a.nd more or less begging \nrequest \nThe Grea.t Southern and Western Railwa.y, as Mr. \nSexton showed at _the recent meeting, performed a very \nremarkable financial fea.t. It purchased some business \nthat brought in a. revenue of about £100,000 a year, \nand to purchase that £100,000 a year it created a ue,v \npreference capital of £4,000,000 a.t an a.nnual charge \nover the heads of the Ordinary Stockholders of from \n£160,000 to ~170,000. It is not every person that \nwould be earned away by a flight of financial genius to \nraise a sum of £4,000,000 in order to purchase a. loss of \n£60,000 or £70,000 a year.

If the \nrate went to the upk eep of a. University Institution of \nacknowledged standing and merit, like University Col­\nlege, Stephen's Green , and not to some merely nebulous \nestablishment, it would be given the monopoly.

C . Mc \\VAL 'l'ER . \nA REVIEW O.F EDUCATION IN IRELAND-III.­\n( C ont·inu.ed.} \nDown to 1878 Catholic Intermed iate Education was \nabsolutely unendowed . There were endowments of Inter­\nmediate Education-and rich ones-but non-Catholics \nexclusively enjoyed them. In that year Earl Cairns intro­\nduced the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Bill, and it \nwas without much difficulty passed into law. The sum of \n£1,000,000 out of the surplus fund of the Disesfai~lished \nChurch was set aside for the purpose. All Insh In­\ntermediate Schools might wip their share of the annual \nrevenue which that capital afforded, according as each \nproved its efficiency in op~n competition. But the \nCatholic and the non-Catholic Schools entered the arena \nunder widely different circumstances. The . latter had \ntheir endowments , and a supposed educational supe• \nriority. The Catholic Schools ~a~ no endowmei:ts, and \na supposed inferiority. The privilege of competm_g was \nsimply given to them; that was all.. Th~ pres~1ge of \nnon-Catholic education had become a trachtion rn Ire­\nland. Quite naturally. • I have been told by some of \nthose who were teaching in Catholic Schools at tl~e \ntime, that they sent their pup~ls to the first year's exami­\nnations with fear and trembling. But the result was a \nrevela,tion. Their pupils left their co~petitors behind ; \nand their victory, year by year ~ver_ smce, has brought \neducational prestige over to their side. The Interme­\ndiate System has had this importa~1t effect : it has 1:°ade \nCatholic teachers and pupils conscious _of an educational \nsuperiority of which they were unconscious before. T~ey \nhave come to believe in themselves; and non-C~thohcs, \namongst them Dr. Archdall the Protestant bishop o-f \nKillaloe, and Dr . Bunbury , Protestant bishop of Lime ­\nrick in his notorious Synodal Address t1uee years ago, \nbav~ openly admitted their super~01:it.y. . ';1-'he \nsystem has this other impo!·tant result: 1t 1s m prrnc1ple \na denominat.ional system. . '.rhe old subterfuge of refus­\ning public money to denominational Coll~ge~ can be con­\nsistently :resorted to no more. The pn_n~1ple of secu­\nlarism has· ceased to be sacred. Competitive tests have \nexploded its excellence; the ~egisl~tu;re itself has rele­\ngated it to· the past as a: p~bhc prmc1pl_e. lf I ~m re­\nminded that the Intermediate system 1s educat10nally \ndefective, that victory under it does not connote true \neducational efficiency, I ~·eadily assent. Public com­\npetition has its right plac;e when one's education, such \nas it may be, is completed; but F think that introduced \nbefore that term it tends to vitiate the process of educa­\ntion. But here again, Catholics have not created the \nsystem;· they have acepted it for want of better. They \nF\nRED LEWIS and 00. 'S PE!RiFUMES AND TOI. \nLET REQUISITES; 1RISH MANUFACTURE. \nhave aone into an arena not of -their own choice, and \nthey have come out with the laur_els .. If, therefor~, \nCatholic Intermediate Schools be strll said to have their \nshortcomings, let the blame be not put on the~, gut on \nthe system imder which ~b~y have to wo~k. It_1s wor~hy \nof remark that the Chnstian Brothers Schools, which \nare absolutely Oatholic, are of admitted excellence. They \nhave uever come uuder the influence of Government \no-tlicialclom 1101· have they been originally designed under \nGovernme1~t patronage, bub preci'sely against it. ~ore­\nover it is doubtful whether since they have partially \ncha1{ged their primary character a~d ~one und~r the In­\ntermediate System, they have mamtamed their general \nexcellence as primary schools. \nLet us now consider University education. As a \nCa tholic nation, it is our anomalous fate to be ac­\nquainted with non-Catholic Un~versities o~ly. Non­\nCatholic thought permeates our literature, science, _a~d \nart. \\Ve have been reared in that atmosphere. As Ill \nour fathers' time, to s·peak of the gentry was to m~an \nProtestants; so the delusion of identifying P1:otestant1sm \nor secularism with University life came upon us also, \nand is living still-a lingering relic of the past. We. \nhave thus been brought by the force of _ci~cumstances to \nlook on University life and the Catholic idea as alm?st \nincompatible. Little blame ~o us : we ~ave I;een _demed \n• the opportunity and the 1:ight ?f \"'.1tnessmg m our \nmidst the w ork of a Oathohc U mv ersity untramm elled \nby di-tliculties. It has been the persi~tent policy of our \nneighbours to represent the Catholic Church as the \nnurse of obscurantism. They first robbed, and then \nreviled her • and a few Catholics help to keep the illu­\nsion alive, forgetting that tl;iey are defaming their own \nm other and cutting their own throats. ~hat. was the \ncondition of thinas before the Royal Umvers1t y came \nin 1879; but it is° so no longer. The Roy al University \nis not in strictness a University at all; it is simply an \nexamining body. There can be no doubt that its De gre~s \nrequire much more positive knowledge than ~hose of 'I'n­\nnity Co llege; nevertheless, many have obtamed them by \nprivate study as well as those who have undergone a \nforma.J course of teaching; and anyone who has had ex­\nperience in these things k1;1o~vs the differ~nce which that \nm akes in most cases. Ti:uuty College gives Degrees to \ncanclidatee from private study also. \nAs uuder the Intermediate System, so also in the \nR oyal University, the Catholic Co lleges had t? enter the \nlists in their poyerty, whilst the non-Catholic Oolleges \nhad their endowments. The three Queen's Colleges had \nbeen at work for thirty years. £1001,000 of public \nmoney was originally spent on their buildings and \nequipment; and they enjoyed a r~venue of £30-,000 a \nyear. In an able p,1.mphlet published last year, Dr. \nD elaney, S.J.,* poin~,s out that \" the. estimates for th_e \npast three years, 1901-2-3, show that the total expendi­\nture on the three Colleges in these years amounted r~­\nspectively to £34,098, £34,916, and £34,966; and tlus \nlast sum £34,966 is also the estimate for the cm-rent \nyear 1903-4.\" Including the charge involved in t~e \noriginal outlay, the total cost to the taxpayer 1s \n£38,000 a year. The C atholic College had to \ncompete against those three Colleges, with their en­\ndowments and their prestige, in which the education \ngiven, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, \"aims at \nbeing the best which the twentieth century is able to \ndevelop.\" t Let us see some of the results. From the \nyear 1884 to 1896, of the candidates from the C atholic \nUniversity College, Dublin, who passed the B.A. Degree \nof the Royal U uiversity, 80. 7 per cent. took Honom ·s \nand E ,xbibitions; of those from Blackrock College, 92.5 \nper cent. took Honours and Exhibitions. On the other \nside, of those couclidates from the Cork Queen's College, \nonly 60.6 per cent. took Honours and Exhibitions; .of \nthose from the Galway Queen's College,· 68.2 per cent. \ntook Honours and Exhibitions. Again, from the year \n1893 to 1900, in the medical examinations of the Royal . \nUniversity, the following shows the proportion of those \nwho took Exhibitions to those who passed the examina-\n•.-1 Pica. for }',ii,, Play: by Rev.

He showed that up to a \npenny m the pound of the ratable valuation can be \nlevied for the purpose of technical education, and as \nthis has been held to include 'the teaching of modern \nlanguages as 'ivell as physics, chemistry, mathematics \nand the like, it seemed possible tlrn.t even now the \n• County Councils had power to strike a rate which \ncould be employed for the endowment of a University \nInstitute, or at least a short, amending Act would \neasily give t,hem this power. \nThat the County Councils of Ireland would readily \nstrike a rate for that purpose 110 one doubts. If the \nrate went to the upk eep of a. University Institution of \nacknowledged standing and merit, like University Col­\nlege, Stephen's Green , and not to some merely nebulous \nestablishment, it would be given the monopoly. If the \ngrant went to endow schola.rships to which ea.ch C ouncil \nshould have a right of nomin ation, a local interest \nwould be given to the question which should render the \nstriking of t,he rnte the more popular. \nJ . C . Mc \\VAL 'l'ER . \nA REVIEW O.F EDUCATION IN IRELAND-III.­\n( C ont·inu.ed.} \nDown to 1878 Catholic Intermed iate Education was \nabsolutely unendowed . There were endowments of Inter­\nmediate Education-and rich ones-but non-Catholics \nexclusively enjoyed them. In that year Earl Cairns intro­\nduced the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Bill, and it \nwas without much difficulty passed into law. The sum of \n£1,000,000 out of the surplus fund of the Disesfai~lished \nChurch was set aside for the purpose. All Insh In­\ntermediate Schools might wip their share of the annual \nrevenue which that capital afforded, according as each \nproved its efficiency in op~n competition. But the \nCatholic and the non-Catholic Schools entered the arena \nunder widely different circumstances. The . latter had \ntheir endowments , and a supposed educational supe• \nriority. The Catholic Schools ~a~ no endowmei:ts, and \na supposed inferiority. The privilege of competm_g was \nsimply given to them; that was all.. Th~ pres~1ge of \nnon-Catholic education had become a trachtion rn Ire­\nland. Quite naturally. • I have been told by some of \nthose who were teaching in Catholic Schools at tl~e \ntime, that they sent their pup~ls to the first year's exami­\nnations with fear and trembling. But the result was a \nrevela,tion. Their pupils left their co~petitors behind ; \nand their victory, year by year ~ver_ smce, has brought \neducational prestige over to their side. The Interme­\ndiate System has had this importa~1t effect : it has 1:°ade \nCatholic teachers and pupils conscious _of an educational \nsuperiority of which they were unconscious before. T~ey \nhave come to believe in themselves; and non-C~thohcs, \namongst them Dr. Archdall the Protestant bishop o-f \nKillaloe, and Dr . Bunbury , Protestant bishop of Lime ­\nrick in his notorious Synodal Address t1uee years ago, \nbav~ openly admitted their super~01:it.y. . ';1-'he \nsystem has this other impo!·tant result: 1t 1s m prrnc1ple \na denominat.ional system. . '.rhe old subterfuge of refus­\ning public money to denominational Coll~ge~ can be con­\nsistently :resorted to no more. The pn_n~1ple of secu­\nlarism has· ceased to be sacred. Competitive tests have \nexploded its excellence; the ~egisl~tu;re itself has rele­\ngated it to· the past as a: p~bhc prmc1pl_e. lf I ~m re­\nminded that the Intermediate system 1s educat10nally \ndefective, that victory under it does not connote true \neducational efficiency, I ~·eadily assent. Public com­\npetition has its right plac;e when one's education, such \nas it may be, is completed; but F think that introduced \nbefore that term it tends to vitiate the process of educa­\ntion. But here again, Catholics have not created the \nsystem;· they have acepted it for want of better. They \nF\nRED LEWIS and 00. 'S PE!RiFUMES AND TOI. \nLET REQUISITES; 1RISH MANUFACTURE. \nhave aone into an arena not of -their own choice, and \nthey have come out with the laur_els .. If, therefor~, \nCatholic Intermediate Schools be strll said to have their \nshortcomings, let the blame be not put on the~, gut on \nthe system imder which ~b~y have to wo~k. It_1s wor~hy \nof remark that the Chnstian Brothers Schools, which \nare absolutely Oatholic, are of admitted excellence. They \nhave uever come uuder the influence of Government \no-tlicialclom 1101· have they been originally designed under \nGovernme1~t patronage, bub preci'sely against it. ~ore­\nover it is doubtful whether since they have partially \ncha1{ged their primary character a~d ~one und~r the In­\ntermediate System, they have mamtamed their general \nexcellence as primary schools. \nLet us now consider University education. As a \nCa tholic nation, it is our anomalous fate to be ac­\nquainted with non-Catholic Un~versities o~ly. Non­\nCatholic thought permeates our literature, science, _a~d \nart. \\Ve have been reared in that atmosphere. As Ill \nour fathers' time, to s·peak of the gentry was to m~an \nProtestants; so the delusion of identifying P1:otestant1sm \nor secularism with University life came upon us also, \nand is living still-a lingering relic of the past. We. \nhave thus been brought by the force of _ci~cumstances to \nlook on University life and the Catholic idea as alm?st \nincompatible. Little blame ~o us : we ~ave I;een _demed \n• the opportunity and the 1:ight ?f \"'.1tnessmg m our \nmidst the w ork of a Oathohc U mv ersity untramm elled \nby di-tliculties. It has been the persi~tent policy of our \nneighbours to represent the Catholic Church as the \nnurse of obscurantism. They first robbed, and then \nreviled her • and a few Catholics help to keep the illu­\nsion alive, forgetting that tl;iey are defaming their own \nm other and cutting their own throats. ~hat. was the \ncondition of thinas before the Royal Umvers1t y came \nin 1879; but it is° so no longer. The Roy al University \nis not in strictness a University at all; it is simply an \nexamining body. There can be no doubt that its De gre~s \nrequire much more positive knowledge than ~hose of 'I'n­\nnity Co llege; nevertheless, many have obtamed them by \nprivate study as well as those who have undergone a \nforma.J course of teaching; and anyone who has had ex­\nperience in these things k1;1o~vs the differ~nce which that \nm akes in most cases. Ti:uuty College gives Degrees to \ncanclidatee from private study also. \nAs uuder the Intermediate System, so also in the \nR oyal University, the Catholic Co lleges had t? enter the \nlists in their poyerty, whilst the non-Catholic Oolleges \nhad their endowments. The three Queen's Colleges had \nbeen at work for thirty years. £1001,000 of public \nmoney was originally spent on their buildings and \nequipment; and they enjoyed a r~venue of £30-,000 a \nyear. In an able p,1.mphlet published last year, Dr. \nD elaney, S.J.,* poin~,s out that \" the. estimates for th_e \npast three years, 1901-2-3, show that the total expendi­\nture on the three Colleges in these years amounted r~­\nspectively to £34,098, £34,916, and £34,966; and tlus \nlast sum £34,966 is also the estimate for the cm-rent \nyear 1903-4.\" Including the charge involved in t~e \noriginal outlay, the total cost to the taxpayer 1s \n£38,000 a year. The C atholic College had to \ncompete against those three Colleges, with their en­\ndowments and their prestige, in which the education \ngiven, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, \"aims at \nbeing the best which the twentieth century is able to \ndevelop.\" t Let us see some of the results. From the \nyear 1884 to 1896, of the candidates from the C atholic \nUniversity College, Dublin, who passed the B.A. Degree \nof the Royal U uiversity, 80. 7 per cent. took Honom ·s \nand E ,xbibitions; of those from Blackrock College, 92.5 \nper cent. took Honours and Exhibitions. On the other \nside, of those couclidates from the Cork Queen's College, \nonly 60.6 per cent. took Honours and Exhibitions; .of \nthose from the Galway Queen's College,· 68.2 per cent. \ntook Honours and Exhibitions. Again, from the year \n1893 to 1900, in the medical examinations of the Royal . \nUniversity, the following shows the proportion of those \nwho took Exhibitions to those who passed the examina-\n•.-1 Pica. for }',ii,, Play: by Rev.

The Ascendancy \nis the immediate enemy of Ireland, and the enemy that \nmay be tackled, on something like even terms. The As­\ncendancy looks upon itself as \"England's Faithful Gar­\nrison \" over here.

Lehane, B.L., \npublished by Messrs. O'Donoghue and . Co. It is a \nvery interesting pamphlet and deserves to be widely \nread. The squandering and blundering Boards that \nmuddle the affairs of this country have ea.rn.ed all the \nJiaht that can be turned on them. Mr. Lehane's \np~mphlet is full of what we may call glaring statistics \nthat ought to be on the finger ends of all Irishmen. \nThe overtaxation of this country and the story of the \nsquandering Boards are between trhem enough to tem­\npo1:arily depress even a sanguine Irish reformer. The \nworst of the Board evil is, that like the Drink Bill, a \nnumber of people fatten and thrive on it. Ireland is \novertaxed, and Boards squander money, but the class \nwho fatten on the squandering do not mind any more \nthan Mr. Bung minds the evils wrought by the Drink \nBill of £14,000,000. Mr. Bung would like the people \nto drink £28,000,000 a year; and the favomed class \nwho get such a big slice of the fat jobs in the patronage \nof the various Boards would like that twice as much \nagain should be squandered on useless officials. \nThis is an abnormal country indeed. It will be re­\nmembered that the· bribe to \" t~me \" Catholics recently \nheld out by the senile authorities of the P arochial Uni­\nversity was promptly knocked on the head by the \nCatholic Hierarchy. A distinguished Irishman and \necclesiastic, Rev. T. A . Finlay, S.J., is at present the \ncentre of much national interest in view of the self-help \nscheme for facing the University problem which he has \nsubmitted to the country. At the time that the \nBishops pronounced against the Parochial University's \nbribe, we remarked that Clongowes miaht nevertheless \naccept it. The fr·ish Times shook its fist at the bishops, \nand of course the nimble Freeman, and Indcv enclent ran \nup the Pastoral Kopje. The Ir-ish T imes said : -\" The \n.resoluti?n of the Hierarchy makes melancholy readi.ug. \nThey_, hke an oft-quotecl dynasty, seem to have learned \nnothmg_ and forgotten nothing; and it may be that \nthey will complete the parallel by seeing their tem­\nporal power pass from them. Their manifesto contains \nthe sa.me old taunts, the same stale accusations, that \n~~ have ~·ead a hundr~d ti~es.\" And again, the Irish \n'1 imes said of the bishops pronouncement:-\" Their \nwords sound like the last despairing ba,ttle-cry of a \nbeaten army. They know that no matter what they \nmay sa.y or do, the future is not for them.

Finlay, S.J., is at present the \ncentre of much national interest in view of the self-help \nscheme for facing the University problem which he has \nsubmitted to the country. At the time that the \nBishops pronounced against the Parochial University's \nbribe, we remarked that Clongowes miaht nevertheless \naccept it. The fr·ish Times shook its fist at the bishops, \nand of course the nimble Freeman, and Indcv enclent ran \nup the Pastoral Kopje. The Ir-ish T imes said : -\" The \n.resoluti?n of the Hierarchy makes melancholy readi.ug. \nThey_, hke an oft-quotecl dynasty, seem to have learned \nnothmg_ and forgotten nothing; and it may be that \nthey will complete the parallel by seeing their tem­\nporal power pass from them. Their manifesto contains \nthe sa.me old taunts, the same stale accusations, that \n~~ have ~·ead a hundr~d ti~es.\" And again, the Irish \n'1 imes said of the bishops pronouncement:-\" Their \nwords sound like the last despairing ba,ttle-cry of a \nbeaten army. They know that no matter what they \nmay sa.y or do, the future is not for them. No lonaer \ncan meclireval terrors be worked with success to stop the . \nprogress of intellectual :inquiry.\" Thus spake the \nnoble D ·ust JJ.,>n to the despised bishops of Ireland last \nJanuary; no doubt the\" tame\" Catholics consider that \nthat sort of slanging at the bishops as a bench of old \nfogies issuing silly fulminations, is \" class \" and denotes \na. \" liberal \" mind. \nTJ1e annual meeting of Olongowes Union wa.s held on \nSunday last. The F?\"Ceman report tells us that \" a \n~ritish mi<Jitary band played a selection of music dur­\nrng the afternoon,\" and we also read that a cricket \nmaitch was provided for the amusement of the distin­\nguished company.

What is the objection of Sir Horace Plunkett \nand his Board to giving to the clerks in the Veterinary \nBranch of the Dep artment, the usual stipend which men \nOf course, the giving of larger prizes would quickly \nput a stir into departments of Irish musical life, in which \n(as revealed by the Feis Ceoil) animation now seems \nlanguid or lacking.· • But the work depends upon the \nfluctuations and treacheries of public support, concern­\ning which few Irish musical enterprises have a cheerful \ntale to tell; and without more annual sub­\nscriptions from the well-to-do, more gate-money at con­\ncerts and competitions, more competitors' fees (though \nthese are a trifle), the work cannot progress-can it even \ncontinue 1 The present has been a year of economy. \nBy cutting off composers' competitions, and the expenses \ninvolved in the production of prize competitions, the \nCommittee have sought to retrieve their loss of last year. \nWe hope they have fully succeeded in their aim. The \nfestival has not, I think, lost greatly in interest through \nthe subtraction of the prize-competition element. Many \nask whether it is at all necessary or desirable to stimulate \nthe production of important musical works so often as \nonce a year, or even once in two years. But though we \nanswer this question in the negative, it is still clear \nthat the expense of composers' competitions must fall, \nat-intervals more or less frequent, upon the shoulders of \nthe Feis Committee; and the public must show, in a \npractical way; lts desire, if it has a desire, to elicit more \nsuch works as Hamilton Harty's \"Irish Symphony,\" \nand to develop more orchestras and conductors able to \nperform them . So far as we can see, the moneys placed \nin the hands of the Committee are utilised with admir­\nable economy . I take up at hap-hazard the accounts as \npublished for 1901, and find that out of an income of \nabout £1;000 from all sources, £340 were spent on prizes \narid medals, £167 on adjudicators, £216 on various \nstrictly musical expenses, while only £91 is allowed for \n. having the knowledge and experience they have, in: \nvariably get. It seems there has been an all-rouu cl \nraising of the salaries and increments in the other \nbranches ?f the Department·,, but, as. would appear by \nthe questions so repeatedly asked m the House of \nCommons, the Veterinary sta,fl', which is to a man almost \nCatholic, has been left out in the cold.

Ireland is overtaxed, and Boards squander money, but the class who fatten on the squandering do not mind any more than Mr. Bung minds the evils wrought by the Drink Bill of £14,000,000. Mr. Bung would like the people to drink £28,000,000 a year; and the favomed class who get such a big slice of the fat jobs in the patronage of the various Boards would like that twice as much again should be squandered on useless officials. This is an abnormal country indeed. It will be re­ membered that the bribe to \" tme \" Catholics recently held out by the senile authorities of the P arochial Uni­ versity was promptly knocked on the head by the Catholic Hierarchy. A distinguished Irishman and ecclesiastic, Rev. T. A .

At the time that the Bishops pronounced against the Parochial University's bribe, we remarked that Clongowes miaht nevertheless accept it.

THE LEADER. 25). \nwho pointed out· that over £50,000 per annum could \neasily be raised by the Oounty and Borough Councils \nto endow a University if they had the power to allocate \nmoney _for su~h a purpose. He showed that up to a \npenny m the pound of the ratable valuation can be \nlevied for the purpose of technical education, and as \nthis has been held to include 'the teaching of modern \nlanguages as 'ivell as physics, chemistry, mathematics \nand the like, it seemed possible tlrn.t even now the \n• County Councils had power to strike a rate which \ncould be employed for the endowment of a University \nInstitute, or at least a short, amending Act would \neasily give t,hem this power. \nThat the County Councils of Ireland would readily \nstrike a rate for that purpose 110 one doubts. If the \nrate went to the upk eep of a. University Institution of \nacknowledged standing and merit, like University Col­\nlege, Stephen's Green , and not to some merely nebulous \nestablishment, it would be given the monopoly. If the \ngrant went to endow schola.rships to which ea.ch C ouncil \nshould have a right of nomin ation, a local interest \nwould be given to the question which should render the \nstriking of t,he rnte the more popular. \nJ . C . Mc \\VAL 'l'ER . \nA REVIEW O.F EDUCATION IN IRELAND-III.­\n( C ont·inu.ed.} \nDown to 1878 Catholic Intermed iate Education was \nabsolutely unendowed . There were endowments of Inter­\nmediate Education-and rich ones-but non-Catholics \nexclusively enjoyed them. In that year Earl Cairns intro­\nduced the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Bill, and it \nwas without much difficulty passed into law. The sum of \n£1,000,000 out of the surplus fund of the Disesfai~lished \nChurch was set aside for the purpose. All Insh In­\ntermediate Schools might wip their share of the annual \nrevenue which that capital afforded, according as each \nproved its efficiency in op~n competition. But the \nCatholic and the non-Catholic Schools entered the arena \nunder widely different circumstances. The . latter had \ntheir endowments , and a supposed educational supe• \nriority. The Catholic Schools ~a~ no endowmei:ts, and \na supposed inferiority. The privilege of competm_g was \nsimply given to them; that was all.. Th~ pres~1ge of \nnon-Catholic education had become a trachtion rn Ire­\nland. Quite naturally. • I have been told by some of \nthose who were teaching in Catholic Schools at tl~e \ntime, that they sent their pup~ls to the first year's exami­\nnations with fear and trembling. But the result was a \nrevela,tion. Their pupils left their co~petitors behind ; \nand their victory, year by year ~ver_ smce, has brought \neducational prestige over to their side. The Interme­\ndiate System has had this importa~1t effect : it has 1:°ade \nCatholic teachers and pupils conscious _of an educational \nsuperiority of which they were unconscious before. T~ey \nhave come to believe in themselves; and non-C~thohcs, \namongst them Dr. Archdall the Protestant bishop o-f \nKillaloe, and Dr . Bunbury , Protestant bishop of Lime ­\nrick in his notorious Synodal Address t1uee years ago, \nbav~ openly admitted their super~01:it.y. . ';1-'he \nsystem has this other impo!·tant result: 1t 1s m prrnc1ple \na denominat.ional system. . '.rhe old subterfuge of refus­\ning public money to denominational Coll~ge~ can be con­\nsistently :resorted to no more. The pn_n~1ple of secu­\nlarism has· ceased to be sacred. Competitive tests have \nexploded its excellence; the ~egisl~tu;re itself has rele­\ngated it to· the past as a: p~bhc prmc1pl_e. lf I ~m re­\nminded that the Intermediate system 1s educat10nally \ndefective, that victory under it does not connote true \neducational efficiency, I ~·eadily assent. Public com­\npetition has its right plac;e when one's education, such \nas it may be, is completed; but F think that introduced \nbefore that term it tends to vitiate the process of educa­\ntion. But here again, Catholics have not created the \nsystem;· they have acepted it for want of better. They \nF\nRED LEWIS and 00. 'S PE!RiFUMES AND TOI. \nLET REQUISITES; 1RISH MANUFACTURE. \nhave aone into an arena not of -their own choice, and \nthey have come out with the laur_els .. If, therefor~, \nCatholic Intermediate Schools be strll said to have their \nshortcomings, let the blame be not put on the~, gut on \nthe system imder which ~b~y have to wo~k. It_1s wor~hy \nof remark that the Chnstian Brothers Schools, which \nare absolutely Oatholic, are of admitted excellence. They \nhave uever come uuder the influence of Government \no-tlicialclom 1101· have they been originally designed under \nGovernme1~t patronage, bub preci'sely against it. ~ore­\nover it is doubtful whether since they have partially \ncha1{ged their primary character a~d ~one und~r the In­\ntermediate System, they have mamtamed their general \nexcellence as primary schools. \nLet us now consider University education. As a \nCa tholic nation, it is our anomalous fate to be ac­\nquainted with non-Catholic Un~versities o~ly. Non­\nCatholic thought permeates our literature, science, _a~d \nart. \\Ve have been reared in that atmosphere. As Ill \nour fathers' time, to s·peak of the gentry was to m~an \nProtestants; so the delusion of identifying P1:otestant1sm \nor secularism with University life came upon us also, \nand is living still-a lingering relic of the past. We. \nhave thus been brought by the force of _ci~cumstances to \nlook on University life and the Catholic idea as alm?st \nincompatible. Little blame ~o us : we ~ave I;een _demed \n• the opportunity and the 1:ight ?f \"'.1tnessmg m our \nmidst the w ork of a Oathohc U mv ersity untramm elled \nby di-tliculties. It has been the persi~tent policy of our \nneighbours to represent the Catholic Church as the \nnurse of obscurantism. They first robbed, and then \nreviled her • and a few Catholics help to keep the illu­\nsion alive, forgetting that tl;iey are defaming their own \nm other and cutting their own throats. ~hat. was the \ncondition of thinas before the Royal Umvers1t y came \nin 1879; but it is° so no longer. The Roy al University \nis not in strictness a University at all; it is simply an \nexamining body. There can be no doubt that its De gre~s \nrequire much more positive knowledge than ~hose of 'I'n­\nnity Co llege; nevertheless, many have obtamed them by \nprivate study as well as those who have undergone a \nforma.J course of teaching; and anyone who has had ex­\nperience in these things k1;1o~vs the differ~nce which that \nm akes in most cases. Ti:uuty College gives Degrees to \ncanclidatee from private study also. \nAs uuder the Intermediate System, so also in the \nR oyal University, the Catholic Co lleges had t? enter the \nlists in their poyerty, whilst the non-Catholic Oolleges \nhad their endowments. The three Queen's Colleges had \nbeen at work for thirty years. £1001,000 of public \nmoney was originally spent on their buildings and \nequipment; and they enjoyed a r~venue of £30-,000 a \nyear. In an able p,1.mphlet published last year, Dr. \nD elaney, S.J.,* poin~,s out that \" the. estimates for th_e \npast three years, 1901-2-3, show that the total expendi­\nture on the three Colleges in these years amounted r~­\nspectively to £34,098, £34,916, and £34,966; and tlus \nlast sum £34,966 is also the estimate for the cm-rent \nyear 1903-4.\" Including the charge involved in t~e \noriginal outlay, the total cost to the taxpayer 1s \n£38,000 a year. The C atholic College had to \ncompete against those three Colleges, with their en­\ndowments and their prestige, in which the education \ngiven, according to Dr. Johnstone Stoney, \"aims at \nbeing the best which the twentieth century is able to \ndevelop.\" t Let us see some of the results. From the \nyear 1884 to 1896, of the candidates from the C atholic \nUniversity College, Dublin, who passed the B.A. Degree \nof the Royal U uiversity, 80. 7 per cent. took Honom ·s \nand E ,xbibitions; of those from Blackrock College, 92.5 \nper cent. took Honours and Exhibitions. On the other \nside, of those couclidates from the Cork Queen's College, \nonly 60.6 per cent. took Honours and Exhibitions; .of \nthose from the Galway Queen's College,· 68.2 per cent. \ntook Honours and Exhibitions. Again, from the year \n1893 to 1900, in the medical examinations of the Royal . \nUniversity, the following shows the proportion of those \nwho took Exhibitions to those who passed the examina-\n•.-1 Pica. for }',ii,, Play: by Rev.

The man Coote, \nof Tyrone, a Justice of the Peace, has stimulated inter­\nest in the Orange Inquisition. It will be remembered that \neven .the Prote.stant incumbent of Clogher, Canon Hare­\n~o~ter, was dragged before this infamous Orange Inqui­\ns1t10n for unw orthy conduct as a Protestant and as· an \nOrangeman. vVe state the charge in the words quoted \nfrom the judgmenti delivered by Mi·. Justice Barton: -\n\" It appears that the defendant brought the Canon 's \nname before the lodge as having been guilty of un­\nworthy conduct as a Protestant minister and a member \nof th<'i lodge by aiding and abetting this Roman Catho­\nlic girl and usii}g his influence against the boycott of the \nschool.\" The Orange Inquisition of Ireland is cer­\ntainly not without interest to others besides the humble \nsewing instructress of Carntall \" non-sectarian\" Na­\ntional School. \nA village sing-song cannot be held in Ireland under \nany title less than a \" grand concert;\" there are any \namount of \" grand \" functionaries in the Oran,ge In­\nquisition; there are \" grand \" masters, \" grand \" chap­\nlains, \"grand\" secretary, \"deputy grand\" chaplains, \ncounty \" grand \" officers and \" grand \" committees. \nThe Rev. Bishop Stack, Clones; the Protestant Bishop \nof Ossory, Kilkenny; the Protestant Bishop of Derry \nand Raphoe are amongst the \" grand \" chaplains; the \nProtestant Bishop of Cashel, the notorious Dr. O'Hara, \nis one of the \" deputy grand \" chaplains. One Major \nA. vV-. Bailey, of the T.0.D. Lodge, is \"grand\" trea­\nsurer. \nAmongst the applications at a recent meeti11g of the \nGrand Orange Lodge of Ireland for new titles for Bel­\nfast the following were granted :-The \"Rising Star,\" \n\" Templemore True Blues,\" \" Ravenhill Guiding Star \" \nin place of \" Kensit Crusaders,\" \" Royal Sovereign \" \ninstead of \" Sandy Row Heroes.\" A scheme for t~ie \nformation of a Political Committee to attend to regis­\ntration matters and to consolidate the Orange vote ju \nMunicipal and Parliamentary Elect.ions_ in the Ci~Y. of \nDublin was approved of.

The Rev.

He was present at the dinner. \nHaving described the scene connected with \" the King\" \nincident, Mr. Dudley Fletcher, B,.D., says:-\" It is \npainful to me to have to record these facts. But can \nany Irishman who loves his country, and has its wel­\nfare at heart, keep silence in the face of them 7 As \nthe Marquis of Londonderry uruly remarked, 'It must \nbe disastrous ,to the interests of the rising generation \nif they were to have inculcated in them feelings of dis­\nloyalty,' and what other feelings will their spiritual \npastol\"s and masters inculcate in them who are capable \nof acting as these acted at the Sligo bang net 7 Will \nnot the result be t'll.at tlie youth of Ireland will be \nturned away from the service of their King and country \ni'1 the most honourable and lucrative positions, such as \nthe Army, the Navy, the police, the Civil Service 1· that \neven in private commercial enterprises they will be \nlooked upon with suspicion, as being re~els at heart ; and \nso will be driven by the stress of poverty to swell the \nranks of the Clan-na-Gael in the United States, there \nto stiir up miscliief against England, and to prevent tnat \nclose friendship whicli ought to subsist between us and \nour America,n cousins ! \" We fear th.at our readers not-\nwith standing their Irish good nature, will heartily en­\njoy the \" pain \" of Rev. Dudley Fletcher and wish him \n\". more o' that to you.\" \nWe have ree'ivea ·from Mr. C. Bull, Suffolk St., Dub­\nlin, a selection of cards containing religious exercises. \nThe cards are of neat design and execution, and are \nprinted by l\\fr. Bull in Dublin. \nWe have been asked to remind our readers that intend·­\ning coiiij_1e€itors at Feis na Mumhan, 1905, should for­\nw:i.rd their entries at once.

Of the six directors three \nare Catholics and three non-Catholics, so if the former \nare any good,and are not mere tame \"tolerance-provers,\" \nthere ought to be little or no scope for bigotry. Mr. \n\"Walter De Foubert is managing director. vVe are not in \npossession of details, and so cannot say whether or not \nthe report that reaches us complaining of bigotry is borne \nout by the facts. \nMilitary bands do not appear to be exactly a red rag \nto the Corporation of Limerick. A member of. that body \npi;oposed that neither the Mayor nor any official of the \nCorporation officially attended the regatta or sports if an \nEugfish military band was engaged. A.lderman Daly \nsa:'l'd he took the resolution as a vote of censure on himself \nfor having attended the regatta as Mayor under the con­\nditions sought to be condemned.

THE LEADER. 247 \no_xplanation offered ,for the deficiency is that these de­\npartments of w,01·k were, to a certain extent taken out \nof its hands. The F. C. collected, ·r believe', a number . \nof_ unpublished airs, but-in the matter of publication the \nw1~d was taken _out of its sails by (especially) the \neditors of the Petn~ collection, whose very poor perform­\nance, contra~t~d with their high promises, we have a.II \nbeen complammg of. As to traditional Irish music, it \nmust be conf~ssed that many difficult problems still \nhang arol~ll~ its nature and proper execution; so tlmt, \nperhaps, it is as well that for the present its practicid \ncare should be largely left to the Gaelic Lean-ue and its \ntheoretical investigation to individual stud~nts like \nFa~her .Bewerunge , Dr. Henebery, and Mr. Rogers. \nT~is year the Feis _Ceoil opened its evening celebrations \nwith a lectlU'e entitled the \" Evolution of Irish l<'olk­\nSong ;\" and unluckily this lecture was uot calculated to \nheighten the reputation of the Fois Ceoil as a form of \nenlightenment on our na.tive music. \n• As to the conipetitions iu singing a.nd ·playing of the \nrecent festiyal, one had to regret (a.s in previous years) \nthe small number of entries in certain sections where \none . would have liked to see (or hear) a warm contest. \nM ost of om· big commercial houses, and nearly al I our \ntrades, are still \"out of it\" iu choral music. Variau, \nPim, Jacob, why do these 1rnmes (all, I think, Quak er \nones) stand solitary 1 Why were the little pupils of the \nGardiner St. Sisters of Charity left alone to give us a \ndelightful rendering of \" The Bells of Shaudon \" and \n\",vhen Winds Breathe Soft 1\" I should be very glad, \ntoo, to see other branches of the Ga elic L eague imitate \nthe example of the Brian Boru Branch , and add to their \nown special concerns the congenial and wholly profitable \nwork of high-class part-singing. Then there wa s disap­\npointment in the matter of bands and orchestras. T11e \nLeinster School Or chestra fouud no coinpetitors, and \nonly one B oys' Brigade Band came forwa-rd. Dublin, \none would fancy, ought to have done better, even with \nthe rest of the country sitting still. For two or three \nmore of such entries one would, readily sacrifice many of \nthe fifty-four mezzo-soprani and of the forty-one pianists \n-though these pianists were really a good lot. \n\"salaries and wao-es,\" and official sundries are evidently • \nkept down to tl~ lowest rate. Would t?,at certain ?f \nour public departments would spend then· resources m \nsimilar proportions!

It is amenable to criticism, ancl \neven open to suggestion. In last issue I pointed out \nwhat hardships Irish fishermen had to suffer at the \nhands of pirate fisher crews from Co rnwall, France and \nScotland, who dredged the oyster-beds regardless of \nseason or size of the oyster taken, and who trawled the \nfishing grounds in a way that killed the young fry and \ndrove the more mature fish to other spawning grounds. \nThe hint has been taken. An additional boat has been \nput on patrol duty. The steamer belonging to the \nCongested Districts' Board-she has an . Irish name­\nthe \" Granuaile,\" ,tncl the \" Helga \" the steam cruiser \nof the D epartment are now on patrol duty. Further, \nwith the sanction of the Naval authorities, instructions \nhave been issued to every coastguard station in Ireland \nto report by telegram to the D epartment in Merrion \nRow, any breaches of the regulations relating to trawl­\ning; whether any foreign boats come w ithin the three­\nmile limit of the shore; and any breach of the fishery \nlaws they may observe. \nT'hese regulations it is to be hoped will ensure a \nmuch better system of check on the depredators who ' \nhave so ruined the fishing grounds. The Departm ent \nby previous arrangement, know s exactly where to find \nthe patrol steamers clay by da.y if they are not within \nreach of the Coastguard and C ustom Officials, and the \nC'aptains of the respective steamers have been furnished \nwith warrants which constitute them a naval police, and \nempowe r them to arrest and detain the delinquents. \nseize the vessels and fishing gear, bring the offenders \nbefore the nearest Magistrate, and have them sum­\nmarily dea.lt with by fine and imprisonment. The Ca.p­\ntains of the patrol boats can further examine the fishing. \ngear of the boats who have a legitimate right to be \non the fishing grounds, and see if the fishing gear is \nmade according to law; to see if the m eshes of the net \nare the right size, and the diameter of the rings forming \nthe oyster-bag trawl are not smaller than the pre­\nscribed size. But we may ask, why were not all these \nregulations promulgated sooner 1 On the English and \nScotch fishing grounds these rules have been in force \nfor the last twenty years; why not have copied them \nsooner 1 To make the patrol duty really effective, how ­\never, at least two additional sw ift steamers or gun -' \nboats should be added to the two already 0 11 du ty, :ind \nas an incentive, a portion of the fine infli<;tcd ought to \nbe given to the coastguards and the crews of the \nsteamers as rewards to make them active aud vigilant. \nTurning now to a matter which has been before Par­\nliament in a desultory way, off and on for the last two \nsessions. What is the objection of Sir Horace Plunkett \nand his Board to giving to the clerks in the Veterinary \nBranch of the Dep artment, the usual stipend which men \nOf course, the giving of larger prizes would quickly \nput a stir into departments of Irish musical life, in which \n(as revealed by the Feis Ceoil) animation now seems \nlanguid or lacking.· • But the work depends upon the \nfluctuations and treacheries of public support, concern­\ning which few Irish musical enterprises have a cheerful \ntale to tell; and without more annual sub­\nscriptions from the well-to-do, more gate-money at con­\ncerts and competitions, more competitors' fees (though \nthese are a trifle), the work cannot progress-can it even \ncontinue 1 The present has been a year of economy. \nBy cutting off composers' competitions, and the expenses \ninvolved in the production of prize competitions, the \nCommittee have sought to retrieve their loss of last year. \nWe hope they have fully succeeded in their aim. The \nfestival has not, I think, lost greatly in interest through \nthe subtraction of the prize-competition element. Many \nask whether it is at all necessary or desirable to stimulate \nthe production of important musical works so often as \nonce a year, or even once in two years. But though we \nanswer this question in the negative, it is still clear \nthat the expense of composers' competitions must fall, \nat-intervals more or less frequent, upon the shoulders of \nthe Feis Committee; and the public must show, in a \npractical way; lts desire, if it has a desire, to elicit more \nsuch works as Hamilton Harty's \"Irish Symphony,\" \nand to develop more orchestras and conductors able to \nperform them . So far as we can see, the moneys placed \nin the hands of the Committee are utilised with admir­\nable economy . I take up at hap-hazard the accounts as \npublished for 1901, and find that out of an income of \nabout £1;000 from all sources, £340 were spent on prizes \narid medals, £167 on adjudicators, £216 on various \nstrictly musical expenses, while only £91 is allowed for \n. having the knowledge and experience they have, in: \nvariably get. It seems there has been an all-rouu cl \nraising of the salaries and increments in the other \nbranches ?f the Department·,, but, as. would appear by \nthe questions so repeatedly asked m the House of \nCommons, the Veterinary sta,fl', which is to a man almost \nCatholic, has been left out in the cold.

L imerick, close to Knocldong. It \nconsists of a long ridge of sandstone topped with conglomerale trenching \neast and west, the northern face being steep, and near the summit \nforming a low cliff marked in the O.S. as \"The Benches.\" 'fhe eastern \nend rising to a height of r,53 r feet at the point called the \"pinnacle\" \non the map. This is a well marked point when seen from below. \nThe view from the top on a clear day is remarkable, extending \n' over the plains of the Co. Limerick; to the north-east is the Glen \nof Aherlow, over which Slieve Reagh seems to stand guard at its western \nentJance; away to the west is the green hill of Ard Patrick, at the foot \nof the N. slopes of the Ballyhoura range, and south,vard the view is one \nof gently undulating hills and vales. \n(26) \" Labbanabiertha\" is marked on the O. S. map close to the stone circle. This \nis said to be a natural formation of the cliff, overhanging; Bheara (.Bhlurtha) was a \nwitch (see Borlase, Dolmens of Ireland, p. 837; Lime,ick Field Club Journal, Vol. \nIII., p. 8), and I presume the rock got its name from some fancied resemblance \nto a hag or witch. The name appears to have been known in this district, for the \ncro1nleac at the foot of Slievereagh is called Clochavarra. \n'",

We had hoped th~t ~his week we \nwould have been able to bury the mc1dent; 1mfor­\ntuna.tely, the Executive Co1!1mitt?e have only aggra­\nvated the situation. The clnef thmg about the resolu­\ntion passed at the mee_ting last Thursday i~ the fact \ntha~ it studiously abstamed from the expr~ss1~11 of the \nleast regret to-Dr. Mc Walter, T.C., and his fnends for \nfihe corner-boy behaviour of the roughs at the procession. \nNow either the majority at the meeting felt no regret, in \nwhich case they would he actual sympathisers with the \nroughs, or though feeling regret, they were afraid to \nexpress it; perhaps the majority was composed of \nthose who felt no regret and those who felt _regret hut \nw ere afraid to express it-in any case the gravity of the \nsituation is patent to all. . • • \n'I'he Language movement is above all parties, persons \nand cliques; the language is the fulcrum upon which \nonly an Irish and distinct civilisation can be lifted into \nexistence; but the policy and conduct of a special \norganisation like the Gaelic League that has to do con­\nsiderably with the desperate attempt to rehabilitate the \nlanguage in face of stupendous difficulties is a matter \nthat, of course, no one concerned in the greater question \nof a distinct Irish civilisation can afford to overlook. \nF or some time past, it is plain,. there has been a lack \nof tact, indeed an abundance of what we might call \nanti-tact displayed by some of the powers that be in \nthe organisation. With a month to consider the matter \nand in face of the various resolutions, protests and so \nforth, both public and private, we were confident that \nthe Executive Committee would be wise, firm and \nstrong enough to do the tactful thing and so put an \nend to the ugly crisis precipitated by street rowdies. \nTh e Ex ecutive Committee has shown about as much \ntact as the rest, with the result that the situ·ation is \nnow worse than ever. Let us recall that attacks on the \nLEADER w ere made at a meeting before Language We ek \nover which one of the Vice-Presidents of the League \npresided; a paper that has been called a \" confrere \" \nby the officia.l organ of the League suggested before \nLangu age Week that every ·shilling given to the Lan­\nguage Fund would be a blow at the-LEADER, and sub­\nsequent to that the official, officials or Committee con­\ncerned ostentatiously advertised the collection in the \n\" confrere \"' of the official orga1i that had suggested that \nevery shilling given to the Fund would be a blow at \nthe LEADER and as ostentatiously boycotted the latter \npaper. After the street rowdyism at the Procession, \nthis. particular· \" confrere \" of the official organ of the \nGaelic League clapped the street rowdies on the back \nand approved their conduct. Is the majority of the \nExecutive Committee in sympathy with the roughs and \ntheir friends 1 Or, if not in sympathy with them , are \nthey afraid to offend them by expressing regret to Dr. \nMcWalter, T.C., to Mr. Gore, and to the Editor of \nthis paper 1 That is the natural question, the inevitable \nquestion, which the resolution passed at last Thursday's \nmeeting must suggest to every intelligent man who \nfollows the matter. If the Executive Committee of the \nGaelic _League can be dictated to by the friends of street \nbrawlers, theu the outlook for the organisation as _at \npresent constituted is ominous indeed. Now, at the \nDublin Co1ru e Ce.,nnc,\\11' at which ten men attended, \nLhe following resolution was passed:-\" \"While we regret \nthat even in one isolated instance the harmony of the \nL11nguage Procession should have been disturbed, yet, \nas the incident referred to was caused by persons acti~g \nwithout authority, and was due to the unauthorised \nintroduction of an individual into the section reserved \nfor the Corpo~·ation, we clo not consider that action on \nour part is'called for.\" That resolµtion on_ly aggravated \nthe situation, and since then we have been receiving \nprotests, and several branches of the Gaelic League have \npassed resolutions. At Thursday's meeting of the \nExecutive Committee, the following resolution was \npassed : -\" While we regret that even in one isolated \ninstance the harmony of the language procession should \nhave been disturbed, yet as the incident referred to",

We had hoped tht his week we would have been able to bury the mc1dent; 1mfor­ tuna.tely, the Executive Co1!1mitt?e have only aggra­ vated the situation.

VVe, for our part, \nbeg to suggest that \" all true friends of the movement '' \nwould be better employed in disa:ssociating a noble and \nhonourable cause from all connection with street blaok­\nguardism and foot-pad tactics. It is for the 1mr• \nticular Irish public concerned to differentiate if they \ncan .between tweedledum and tweedledee. There is no \napology to Dr. McWalter, T.C., to his friend Mr. John \nGore, or to the Editor of this paper. What are these \ntrio compa ,red to the street roughs, their aiders, ab­\nbetors and applauders 1 Were there men who must not \nbe disobeyed by the majority of the Coir-oe 511ot\" at \nthis meeting around the corner on Thu rsday night last? \nThe resolution of the Executive Committee appears \nto us to be quite absurd as well as an aggravation of \nthe insult offered to Dr. M 'Walter, T.C., and his friends \nin the streets of Dublin on the occasion of the Proces­\nsion. Surely it was unnecessary to formally declai:e \nthat that body regretted that the harmony of the Dub­\nhn Procession was disturbed; we should have thought \nthat that might be taken for granted; all people con­\ncerned in any enterprise natw-ally wish that it should \nbe carried out harmoniously, and one would think it \nrather unnecessary for them to state that, street roughs \nintervening, they regretted the want of harmony. Of \ncow-se they did; so would any collection of human be­\nings; and the particular want of harmony having led \nto other more serious disturbances in the way of branch \nresolutions, protests, etc., naturally the regret is inten­\nsified. Surely no one who protested and asked for an \napology thought that the Co1r'Ce 5110.t,1 organised the \nstreet-rough escapade! Why, then, point out that the \nblackguardism was enacted by \" persons acting without \nauthority \" The Organisation, in many devious ways, \nas we have over and over again shown, had got itself \nexpressly mixed up in the matter, yet the Executive \nCommittee did not feel called upon to express even a \nformal regret 'to D1:. M 'W alter, T .C., and his friends on \naccount of the blackguardism to which they were sub· \njected by roughs at the Procession, one of whom wore a \nbadge upon his arm . The absurd resolution as it stands \nreally in a round-about way emphatically says:- \" We \ndon't wish to, or we dare not, offer any apology, \nor denounce the conduct of the street roughs.'' \nThat is the meaning of the resolution in so far as it \nmeans anything; and it appears to ·us that the long­\ndrawn-out exhibition of lack of tact is fully capped by \nthis resolution of the Executive Committee who have \nadded aggravation after the Dublin Co1r-oe Ce .<11111-\nC.(\\IJI had added insult to injury. \nSupposing that a vofo of condolence was proposed at a \nmeeting of responsible persons to the relatives of some­\none who had recently died, and supposing that meeting \nresolved that as they had nothing to do with bringing \nabout the death of the person they considered that no \naction on their part was called for-what would be \nthought of such a resolution 1 Dr. M'W •alter and his \nfriends are to receive no apology as the Executive Com­\nmittee did not authorise the roughs--one with a badge \non his arm-to hold up the carriage of a member of the \nDublin Corporation invited to the Procession ! Those \nbranches of the Gaelic League and individuals who have \nexpressed their regret at the blackguardism must . be \ni:adly lacking in that luminous and subtle intellectua­\nlity which, perhaps, for ought we know, may distin­\nguish the resolution of the Executi:ve Committee; for \nthese did not authorise the blackguarclism either, al­\nthough they vigorously condemned it I We note that \nthe ExecuUve, having emphaticii.lly declined ~o e~press \nany regret to D1·. M'Walter, T.0., and his friends·, \nand having declined to denounce the street roughs, \ntrust that no more will be said about the matter. That \nalso is brilliant.. If a company owed five thousand \npounds to their creditors, and resolved that t~ey would \nnot pay it, it would be very brilliant on their part to \nsuggest that, in the interests of peace and quietness, \nthere should be no more said about the matter by the \ncreditors and their friends. The Executive Committee \nsurely owed an expression of regret to Dr. M'Wal~er, \nT.C., and his guests. Either not wishing or not danng \nto pay it, they hope that no more will be said about \nt:heir liabilit,y. \nNow, supposing that Dr. M'Walter and his friends \ndid not keep control of their tempers, and suppose that \none of the roughs applauded by a \" confrere \" of the \nofficial organ of the Gaelic League was struck, and tliat \na riot and bloodshed ensued, as easily might have hap­\npened; supposing a few corpses were laid out in the \nMorgue, would the Executive Committee resolve that as \nthey did not authorise the slaughter that no action on \ntheir part was called for? Who will be the victim next \nyead Supposing that the .Ai·chbishop of Dublin at­\ntended the Procession next year, and that be was as­\nsa,ulted by a gang of roughs, one with a badge on his \nsleeve, would the E .xecutive Committee, in solemn con­\nclave assembled, say that as the roughs assaulted the \nArchbishop without authority, no action was called for \non their part? \nIs the influence represented by street roughs dominant \nin the Central Counsels of the Gaelic League 7 Is the \npolicy of the Ex ecutive dictated by fear of street roug4s \nand their friends 7 We had hoped to be able to bury \nthe incident in this week 's issue ; the Executive Com­\nmittee have not seen w ell to dig a pit in which we could \nplace it and cover it up . They have aggravated a dis­\nagreeable situation, and have refu§ed to rub the gutter \noff the organisation with which the roughs at the Lan­\nguage Procession succeeded in fouling it. \nWe feel sure that the members of England's Faithful \nGarrison in Ireland , the reo111i11i, the West Britons and \nother enemies of Ireland feel that they owe a debt of \ngratitude to the DublinC01ru eCe ,,1111c<1111, to the roughs, \nand last but not least to the m em hers of the Executive \nCommittee responsible for the absurd resolution passed \nlast Thursday. \nThe resolution of the majority at the Executive Com­\nmittee meeting is in opposition to several of the \nbranches who had thought it well to declare upon \nthe matter beforehand. We do not know how many \nbranches thought well to move in the matter; we pre­\nsume that most branches, looking forward confidently to \nthe Executive Committee doing the tactful and the right \nthing, took no action in the hope that the crisis would \nbe got over by proper action on the part of the Execu­\ntive. The resolution of the Executive is in op­\nposition to the Gavan Branch, the committee of which \nunanimously agreed in asking whether any step had \nbeen or would be taken to repudiate the action of the \nroughs. It is opposed to the view of the Father \nSherlock Branch, Birmingham, whose President wrote \nin a letter already published by us that he was authorised \nby tha~ branch \" to_ protest in its name against the in­\n~u;lt ?ffered to you m the Language Procession, and to \nJOrn_m the c\\ema11d that you shall receive adequate satis­\nfact1011 for the same from the authorities of the Gaelic \nL~ag1;1e.\" I~ is ;ontrai:y to the Cleaver Branch , \nDublm, who, m thei_r pubhshed resolution called \"upon \nth~ Co,r-oe Eno~ ~'. 1~1 t~e name of the League to dis­\nclann all responsi~nh~y m the matter, and to condemn • \nthe a1~thors of the mcident.\" It is out of line with the \ncommittee of the Clonmel B:ranch, who resolved-u-T'hat \nwe, the me~bers of the Clonmel Branch of the Gael~~ \n~eague, desire to record our deep regret that the govern­\nmg ~ody o~ the_League has not before now thought well \nto disassociate itself from any appearance of sympathy . \n. 1 \ni \nt \nI \n,I \nI· \nl \n\\· \n!",

He knows, for he openly avows at page \n106 of lus book and ~lsewhere, that \"they (the priests) \ndo not put obstacles rn the way of the Roman Catholic \nmajority choosiug Protestant,s for nolitical leaders.\" \nthat \"his own experience distinctly 1Jrnves that it is ;,o \ndisadvantage to a man to be a Protestant in Irish politi­\ncal life.\" He knows that he owes it to the cordial sym­\npathy and help of the priests that it has been possible for \nhim to do the industrial work which he has already \ndone iri the country. Even still they stick to him , be­\ncause they believe in his work, if not in his wisdom . It \nis not, therefore, fair for him to ascribe the recent pro­\ntests raised against certain parts of his book to either his \nProtestantism or to his criticism. He was as much a \nProtestant when he began the industrial movement as \nhe is to-day, and yet they at once joined him in cordial \nco-operation. As to criticism, he has never criticised \nthe Catholics, clergy and laity, half so freely or ~o \nforcibly as the Editor of the LEAD .ER has done, ai:id 1s \ndoing; and yet so far is it from having been repudiated \nby the Catholics, that it is by a certain ~lass called a \n\" clerical organ.\" The Editor was an admirable apostle \nof enlightened thought whils~ he criticised clergy, con­\nvents, colleges, and Catho!1cs alone; ~mt when he \nbrouaht others also under lus lasl1 and Ins laughter h£' \nbeca~e miraculously metamorphosed into \" a clerical \norgan,'' and an unmannei'ly man. \nAt page 329 he writes-\" I hope tlia~ both my Roman \nCatholic and my Protesta.nt readers will now see why I \n• was moved to impress upon the Roman Catholic clergy \nthe urgent necessity for building up an industrial cha~·­\nacter in a people whom historical causes have e~onom1-\ncally depressed.\" He need not have troubled ~o 1mpi:ess \nupon the priests what they kn~w already, a~d m relation \nto which they have shown quite as_ much mterest as he \nhas. And if he had kept to that general reference to \n\"historical causes\" in his book, he would never ha,ve \nheard a complaint from the Catholics about it ..

But I quote the following from page 325 of the­\nEpilogue, in reference to church-building : -;-\n\" My remarks as to the alleged e:1'cess1ve chur~h­\nbuilding were, I regret to say, made m a form which· \nlaid me open to misconception. Some readers feel that \nI did not make sufficient allowance for the fact that \nmuch church-building was absolutely required for the \nmere physical accommodation of a people among whom­\nreaular church attendance is practically universal, and \nwho had been deprived of all the ancient chw·ches of \nthe country. It is also w·ged that the extravagance. \ncomplained of is the exception and not the rule. AH \nthis I aladly admit. Still, what strikes many observers \nis the ~ndisputed fact that while ~he nu~ber ~f-Catholi~ \nchw·ches and religious houses 1s raptdly nsmg, the. \nCatholic population itself is rapidly falling. Had the \nreverse been true, my strictures would have been m~re· \nopen to objection. I trust, however, that I shall give \nno fresh offence if I express the hope that the zea~ no_w \nput forth in church-building may find a count~rpo1se m \n& viaorous effort to improve the economic conchtion of a \npeople who must be presei:ved to t?-e coun~ry if ,~he­\nchw·ches are not to be emptied of then· worsluppers. \nOn this I observe-1st.

Sir Horace mistakes an •1:ncrease i1i nm11-\nber for a subst·it·ution of' nwmbers. In other words, if the \nCatholics of a dozen parishes build a. dozen new churches \nto replace a dozen old ones!

      "raw_text": "180 THE LEADER. .APRIL 22. 1905. \nwas cau_sed by persons acting without authority, we do \nnot consj.der that action on our part is called for and \nwe call ·on all true friends of the movement to ~void \nfurther controversy in the matter.\" It will be noted \nthat this r~solution is the same as the absurd and \nloudly condemned resolution of the Dublin Co1r'Oe \nCe\"nm:;A11, but for the fact that the words \"and was \ndue. to the unauthorised introduction of an individual \ninto a section reserved for the Corporation \" are \nomitted, and that the exhortation \" and we 'call on \nall t.rue friends of the movement to n.void further con• \ntroversy in the matter\" are added. VVe, for our part, \nbeg to suggest that \" all true friends of the movement '' \nwould be better employed in disa:ssociating a noble and \nhonourable cause from all connection with street blaok­\nguardism and foot-pad tactics. It is for the 1mr• \nticular Irish public concerned to differentiate if they \ncan .between tweedledum and tweedledee. There is no \napology to Dr. McWalter, T.C., to his friend Mr. John \nGore, or to the Editor of this paper. What are these \ntrio compa ,red to the street roughs, their aiders, ab­\nbetors and applauders 1 Were there men who must not \nbe disobeyed by the majority of the Coir-oe 511ot\" at \nthis meeting around the corner on Thu rsday night last? \nThe resolution of the Executive Committee appears \nto us to be quite absurd as well as an aggravation of \nthe insult offered to Dr. M 'Walter, T.C., and his friends \nin the streets of Dublin on the occasion of the Proces­\nsion. Surely it was unnecessary to formally declai:e \nthat that body regretted that the harmony of the Dub­\nhn Procession was disturbed; we should have thought \nthat that might be taken for granted; all people con­\ncerned in any enterprise natw-ally wish that it should \nbe carried out harmoniously, and one would think it \nrather unnecessary for them to state that, street roughs \nintervening, they regretted the want of harmony. Of \ncow-se they did; so would any collection of human be­\nings; and the particular want of harmony having led \nto other more serious disturbances in the way of branch \nresolutions, protests, etc., naturally the regret is inten­\nsified. Surely no one who protested and asked for an \napology thought that the Co1r'Ce 5110.t,1 organised the \nstreet-rough escapade! Why, then, point out that the \nblackguardism was enacted by \" persons acting without \nauthority \" The Organisation, in many devious ways, \nas we have over and over again shown, had got itself \nexpressly mixed up in the matter, yet the Executive \nCommittee did not feel called upon to express even a \nformal regret 'to D1:. M 'W alter, T .C., and his friends on \naccount of the blackguardism to which they were sub· \njected by roughs at the Procession, one of whom wore a \nbadge upon his arm . The absurd resolution as it stands \nreally in a round-about way emphatically says:- \" We \ndon't wish to, or we dare not, offer any apology, \nor denounce the conduct of the street roughs.'' \nThat is the meaning of the resolution in so far as it \nmeans anything; and it appears to ·us that the long­\ndrawn-out exhibition of lack of tact is fully capped by \nthis resolution of the Executive Committee who have \nadded aggravation after the Dublin Co1r-oe Ce .<11111-\nC.(\\IJI had added insult to injury. \nSupposing that a vofo of condolence was proposed at a \nmeeting of responsible persons to the relatives of some­\none who had recently died, and supposing that meeting \nresolved that as they had nothing to do with bringing \nabout the death of the person they considered that no \naction on their part was called for-what would be \nthought of such a resolution 1 Dr. M'W •alter and his \nfriends are to receive no apology as the Executive Com­\nmittee did not authorise the roughs--one with a badge \non his arm-to hold up the carriage of a member of the \nDublin Corporation invited to the Procession ! Those \nbranches of the Gaelic League and individuals who have \nexpressed their regret at the blackguardism must . be \ni:adly lacking in that luminous and subtle intellectua­\nlity which, perhaps, for ought we know, may distin­\nguish the resolution of the Executi:ve Committee; for \nthese did not authorise the blackguarclism either, al­\nthough they vigorously condemned it I We note that \nthe ExecuUve, having emphaticii.lly declined ~o e~press \nany regret to D1·. M'Walter, T.0., and his friends·, \nand having declined to denounce the street roughs, \ntrust that no more will be said about the matter. That \nalso is brilliant.. If a company owed five thousand \npounds to their creditors, and resolved that t~ey would \nnot pay it, it would be very brilliant on their part to \nsuggest that, in the interests of peace and quietness, \nthere should be no more said about the matter by the \ncreditors and their friends. The Executive Committee \nsurely owed an expression of regret to Dr. M'Wal~er, \nT.C., and his guests. Either not wishing or not danng \nto pay it, they hope that no more will be said about \nt:heir liabilit,y. \nNow, supposing that Dr. M'Walter and his friends \ndid not keep control of their tempers, and suppose that \none of the roughs applauded by a \" confrere \" of the \nofficial organ of the Gaelic League was struck, and tliat \na riot and bloodshed ensued, as easily might have hap­\npened; supposing a few corpses were laid out in the \nMorgue, would the Executive Committee resolve that as \nthey did not authorise the slaughter that no action on \ntheir part was called for? Who will be the victim next \nyead Supposing that the .Ai·chbishop of Dublin at­\ntended the Procession next year, and that be was as­\nsa,ulted by a gang of roughs, one with a badge on his \nsleeve, would the E .xecutive Committee, in solemn con­\nclave assembled, say that as the roughs assaulted the \nArchbishop without authority, no action was called for \non their part? \nIs the influence represented by street roughs dominant \nin the Central Counsels of the Gaelic League 7 Is the \npolicy of the Ex ecutive dictated by fear of street roug4s \nand their friends 7 We had hoped to be able to bury \nthe incident in this week 's issue ; the Executive Com­\nmittee have not seen w ell to dig a pit in which we could \nplace it and cover it up . They have aggravated a dis­\nagreeable situation, and have refu§ed to rub the gutter \noff the organisation with which the roughs at the Lan­\nguage Procession succeeded in fouling it. \nWe feel sure that the members of England's Faithful \nGarrison in Ireland , the reo111i11i, the West Britons and \nother enemies of Ireland feel that they owe a debt of \ngratitude to the DublinC01ru eCe ,,1111c<1111, to the roughs, \nand last but not least to the m em hers of the Executive \nCommittee responsible for the absurd resolution passed \nlast Thursday. \nThe resolution of the majority at the Executive Com­\nmittee meeting is in opposition to several of the \nbranches who had thought it well to declare upon \nthe matter beforehand. We do not know how many \nbranches thought well to move in the matter; we pre­\nsume that most branches, looking forward confidently to \nthe Executive Committee doing the tactful and the right \nthing, took no action in the hope that the crisis would \nbe got over by proper action on the part of the Execu­\ntive. The resolution of the Executive is in op­\nposition to the Gavan Branch, the committee of which \nunanimously agreed in asking whether any step had \nbeen or would be taken to repudiate the action of the \nroughs. It is opposed to the view of the Father \nSherlock Branch, Birmingham, whose President wrote \nin a letter already published by us that he was authorised \nby tha~ branch \" to_ protest in its name against the in­\n~u;lt ?ffered to you m the Language Procession, and to \nJOrn_m the c\\ema11d that you shall receive adequate satis­\nfact1011 for the same from the authorities of the Gaelic \nL~ag1;1e.\" I~ is ;ontrai:y to the Cleaver Branch , \nDublm, who, m thei_r pubhshed resolution called \"upon \nth~ Co,r-oe Eno~ ~'. 1~1 t~e name of the League to dis­\nclann all responsi~nh~y m the matter, and to condemn • \nthe a1~thors of the mcident.\" It is out of line with the \ncommittee of the Clonmel B:ranch, who resolved-u-T'hat \nwe, the me~bers of the Clonmel Branch of the Gael~~ \n~eague, desire to record our deep regret that the govern­\nmg ~ody o~ the_League has not before now thought well \nto disassociate itself from any appearance of sympathy . \n. 1 \ni \nt \nI \n,I \nI· \nl \n\\· \n!",

There must be a \nsubtle legal intellect among them.

      "raw_text": "9:d THE LEADER. \nIn the yea.a-1905 another Irish Chief Secreta.ry has \nbeen laid low, and the Uuder-Secret.ary has had a ha-rd \nfight to preserve his position. The attackers this time \nhave not resorted to steel, they have not dyed their \nhands with the blood of their victims. They ha.ve, \nbroken no civil law. They a;re not criminals. But they \nhave sought as eage.i:ly, and in one. case they ha.ve suc­\nceeded as completely as did the men of '82 in destroying \nthe official lives of those to whom they were opposed. \nM1·. Wyndham, as. au Irish Chief SecretaJ·y, is as dead \nas Lord Frederick Cavendish; Sir Antony .McDonneil, \nfor aught the public really knows, may lie, so far as his \ncaJ:eer in Ireland is concerned, as near the point of dis­\nsolution as did .Mr. Burke on that May evening long ago. \nThe Invincibles of '82 were, for the most pa.rt, ignorant \nmen possessed of neithei· place nor power, in blind hatred \nof oppression and misrule, which, maybe they but im­\nperfectly unde·rstood the ca,use of, but of whose effects \nthey were well a.wa.re, they enda.ugered body a.nd soul, \nand took two follow-beings' lives-. The Ulster Pa.rty_ of \nto-day boast of their educa,tion, a.nd insist on bemg \nmaintained in 1ihe ,place and power they now enjoy. The \nfear that they ma y uot be so preserved is the, motive tha.t \nhas impelled them in sooking the downfall of the two \nSecreta.ries. Selfishness-,a, personal feeling of each on_e \nfor himself and for his class-is the keynote to the atti­\ntude of the Loyal Unionist. \nThe downfall of lV.Ir. Wyndham has the peculia~·ity \nof being regarded as a triumph by Unionist a.nd Nation­\nalist alike. There ha,s seldom been a case where more \nopposite reasons have been assigned for one happening . \nSome Unionists there ,a.re who pity him, beca.use his\" col­\nleague\" deceived him. They urge tha,t .Mr. Wynd­\nham was not to blame. He never really meant to im­\nprove the methods of Dublin CasUe. He ha.cl no· serious \nintention of affording Ca,tholics a proper system of \nHigher Education. It was not pa,rt of a programme \nwhich he purposed to put into· force that the Ascendancy \nParty should be made forego the position they ·ha.ve held \nso long. His mistake lay in permitting a subordinate \nanimated by these Teactionary sentiments to assume too \nlarge a share in the government of Ireland. \nThe Freeman 's Jo1trnal and the school of politicians, \nof which it is the organ, agree to some extent with these \nviews. They maintain that the ex-Chief Secreta,ry \na-ffected a sympathetic att,itude solely to mislead a,nd dis­\narm the Irish people, and treat the Under-Secretary as \nthe ignis f atuus he employed , to lead them into the \nmorass. On the o-ther hand, some Nationa.list Free­\nthinkerS-:--if they may be so-called-incline sympatheti­\ncally towards Mr. Wyndham. They credit him with \naood intentions which, in this instance, have paved the \n~ay to rather than the floor of the abode of the ruined \nstatesman. So do those IriS'b. Unionists who have sent \nhim thither. \"We are Irishmen,\" they cry, .and one \nfeels tempted to re,ply·in a paraphrase of .Macbeth, \"Aye, \nin the catalogue ye pass for Irishmen.\" \nReduced Crown 8vo. 162 pp. nnd vi., 2/••· \nSTORIES FROM IRISH HISTORY \nTOLD FOR CHILDREN \nBy MRS.

But it is because he \nwas 'deemed sympa ,thetic, beca-use he wa~ supposed to lack \nattachment to the interes.ts of the domma~t pa,rt1, \n1\ntha.t \nhis fall is clue. So perish all who do ,tJhe hke agam • cr_y \nthe Ulster Unionists. Meantime they do not rela~ the1_r \nefforts to destroy the Under-Secretary. About his reh­\naion there, is 110 doubt. He is a Pa,pist: Therefore, De­\n~olutiou or no Devolution, he is obnoxious. He must go. \nBefore any question of it arose }1e was a marked man . \nHe did not belong to the Orange gang; he had no_ sym­\npa.t11ies with the ctiq~ie, ·the price of whose power is the \nruin of a nation. \n·when dealing with the Wyndham-McDonnell episode. \nas it is termed, let not these plain facts be forgotten. \nThe Park Murderers committed their crime in the hope \nof benefiting a nation; the Ulster Unionists and their \nadherents through the country are working solely for \nthemselves. • Avis. \n~•:••!• ............... \nAN IRISH UMBRELLA-MAKING FIRM. \nI\nT is easy to estimate that a. large sum of money leaks \nout-of Ireland through. the purchase of imported \numbrellas. Our uncertain climate sugg-ests a big mar­\nket, for such a.ri.ticles of which market British. manufac­\ntu~·ers take the liou's sha,re. Ireland, however, has \numbrella ma.nttfactm ·e1·s whose hold o·n Uie hom e market \nis increasing. Much of the rn:w mater:ia,l, so to_ speak, \nused by the latter has of necessity to be brought mto the \ncountry, but its manufa ctU'l:e into the finished product \nrepresents a,n Irish industry which is worLhy of whole­\nhearted support. The writer has received a, whole­\nsale cataloQ\"Ue o.f one of these firms, Messrs. Fra,ncis \nSmyth and° Son, whose workshops are situ~.ted in the~r \npremises, 75 Grafton Street, Dublm . It 1s \na neatly go-t up publication, .and comprises a long list \nof the articles made by the firm as well as \nv:arious items such as walking-sticks, Irish blackthorns, \netc,, in which •they .also deal.

All of which, \nhowever, is not arguing that we a.i·e free from the vice \nof factiousne...<s. On the contra.ry, we are far too factious. \njust as we are far too fond of clriuk, for ou,,,. circ11,111-\nstances. But 1.ihe point is that, from constantly having \nthe cry of \"Fa.ctio.n !\" shout<Jd in our ears, and from, \nas I have w·ged, having ou-rse-lves come to slia.re the· be­\nlief tha.t w e a.re more factious tha,n any people on ea,rth, \nour every mov ement is pa-ralysed \\\\~ith fea.r of :traitors \nhere and traitors ·the,re, and the English G overnment a.I, \nthe bottom of the treacherous }Jin.us!

The army can't get on that spends ha,lf its ,time \ncourt-ma.rtia.Uing and shoot;ing supposed traito•rs wh e,n it \nought to· be facing the enem y. \nAfter the qua.rrel between Gr atta.n and Flood, a,nd \nwhe.n the Dublin Parliament was m ost noisy, Barrington \nmade the remark that himself didn't see the necessity \nfor a.11 the fuss, seeing how gloriously the country wa s \nprospering. Perhaps we · might do w oroo tha,n ~imilarly \nask ourselves have we cause, when w e feel inclined to \nget e:x:cited now a,nd tihen. For, indeed, we have glori­\nfied what I may call -the policy of firing on the fishing \nboats. If Dublin is not .a, ca.pit,al in muck else, it cer­\nt~inly concentrates in it.self a good deal o.f our natio-nal \nsuspicion of foul play. Perhaps the Castle or Oastle \nhistory, has something to do with it, but anyhow , Thtb­\nli,n is fuller of plots, real 0 1· imaginary, than a,ny city \nI know. In fact, a man 's ingenuity in supposing plots \nis a, greaiter cla.im to clistinctfou in Dublin tha,n any \nother ta.lent or virtue almost. The ingenious one is f• \nsort of beacon with two lights, one exposing the subtle \nenemy before the eyes of the unsuspecting people•, the \nother shining i11wards on the operator's ow ,n spotless \nsoul. And the fun of it-js, the firs,t-mentioned light \nshows up so many t.raitors that the honest remnant of \nthe -na,tion can be but a. chosen (very) few! \nIt is a, good while now since \"Imaa.J\" wrote about the \namen ities of public life in Ireland. Well, of as much \nimportance as that our public men should be a bit mor e \ncivil to each other is, peroaps, that they should ceMe \nto bother the people with their suspicions. The English \nnewspaper man who comes over to interview someone at. \nthe beginning of the session with a view to eliciting who , \nin his opinion, is just then plotting to be chairman of \nthe Irish Party, is of courre, only poking .the Irish \ndonkey under the straddle for the fun of seeing him \nl10ise, but our own grown-up children who see the yellow \nof English gold in the pockets·of everyone that, start.les \nthem by •having an opinion o.f l1is own, and stat.i.ng it. \nam a nuisa,nce to have about on business days. I ha.ve \nstated my opinion that tihe Irish people are not more \nfactious than any other. What with leaders and plot \ndiscoverers, however, they hardly get a fair chance; in \nfact they are, or were until recently, being made fa.c­\ntious in spite of themselves. As it is their, perhaps, \nmost serious drawback as fighters is tha.t they a,re \napatilietic. To have the fear of faction ever before their \nminds is to keep -them a.pa,thetic. \nTo conclude, I don't know tha,L I have a,ny specific to \npropose for this nervous disorder of ours.

We are only playing second fiddle in \ntreacherous iniquity to Ini.'Jfa•il. \nThe ,re ,bas been quite a controve•rsy in tJhe Dmidalk \nDemocrat about the LEADER; it .a,rose out of the anony­\nmous fulminations written by a Nrr. H enry Morris, who \nis also a member of the Executive of the Gaelic League. \n\\Ve note that this Mr . Henry Morr.is, writing as ''we\" in \nour l!Jundalk contemporary, lets fly to tho extent of \na.bout two colUJlilns, :i.n the issue of February 25th, by \nwa ,y of reply to two· lette,rs tlw:t ha.cl appea,red in a pre­\nvious issue of that paper.

The w1·iter \nof the notes, as we ,have said, is a. membe ,r of the E .xecu­\n.t,ive, and, tberefo-re knows something of the inner \nwol'king. He evidenbly knows why the mighty official \norgan, that cost the:• Language Fund £1,091 fo reoonb \nyears, turns up ite ·haughty nose at us; what is more, \nhe has bltwted out his knowledge .

But, even acoep!Jing; \nthis summing up of the situation, if the ec;l.i:to:r ot ili.e \nClaid11ea1nli were aJtacked by a chimney sweep, would \nhe walk on n,nd allow the sweep ·to co,ntinue 1,h,e attack,. \nlesb he migihti get soUed and blackened in the melee~ \nHe would not, neith.ei• should •he, we hold, allow the­\nLEADEn's attacks to go unchallenged, even though he­\nmight be ca.Jled some ugly nicknames, and •have a lot of \ncoarse fun poked at his hea.d.\" All this is really de­\nlighLiul. So we are Loo \"vulgar\" and \"scurrilous\" to• \nbe spoken to by the highly respectx1,ble and ve,ry \":tony\" \nofficia.J editor! And bhe writer o.f the notes in our \nDundalk oonte.mporary, who is shocked .at our \"scur­\nrility,\" couples us neatly, as· it will have been observed, \nwj.th a chimney sweep! The best thing of all, however, \nis the suggestion that.t:Jhe officia,l editor is afraid to notice \nus, as if he did, ·we might give him a nickname! Picture \na ma,n going into Irish. pwblic life weighed down with \na morbid dread that some one wo uld give •him a nick­\nname 1. Pictm·e the official editor bei,ng offered a brief \nin the Courts. We see him in om: mind's eye w eighing \nup the probwbilities of being called a nickname by the \nopposing counsel; if Tim Hea .ly were ou !Jhe other side, \nhe might consider the risk too great, a.nd might decline \nthe brief. Now if tlhe ·official editor is really in dread of \na nicknam e, he has no reaso·n to be thankful to this \nMr. Morris for lett.iug :bhe, cat out of the bag; for it is \nrumost like offering a. prize to the country for the best. \nnickname for the official editor. \nHere is a grave -indictment from this Mr . Morris:­\n\"Are .not the editorial columns of the LEADER master­\npieces of vituperation 1 Is there a single Irish paper \nhas invented a.nd used morn nick,names durino-the \nfour and a half yea.rs of its existence than the L~ADER \nhas done? Why it would fill coh1mns of ,t.his paper if we \nmade a. compilation of all il1e nickna.mes the LEADE R \nhas ,invented and made use of.\" Well, we certainly wilt \nmake a. clean breast of it, and admit that we did invent \nsome JJicknam es in our time. We believe it was we \nwho nicknamed a certn.in portion of -Lliis nation \"Irish \nIreland.\" We certainly have it on om· conscience tihat \nwe invented \"Sourfaoe\" and \"Saved\"; we first nicknamed \nbhe publicn,ns of this country \"Bung ,\" and c.'\\.lled a type \nof manufactm·ers \"Dark Bro!Jhers.\" We nicknamed n, \noortn.i:n cla.ss of writing-perhaps this Mr. Morris is \ngetting fidgety here-we nicknamed a, certn.in class of \nwriting ''ra:imeis\"--01h, no doubt about it, we have been \ngrea.t sinners ,iin the nicknaming ,line and no mistake .. \nAnd the ,rorst of it is tilrn.t the nickmwn es we ·have in­\nvented so· far are, we trust, nothing to those tha.t ,ve \nhope we will be, inspire-cl to iinvent as Ume goes on. \nA fair indication of the calibre and bra,i,ns and level­\nheadedness of this co1'1--espondent of om· Dunda.Jlc con­\ntemporary who is .a, member of the Executive of the \nGaelfo League, may be judged by one pa,rticula.rly bright; \nsuggestJion. He is talking of \"some friends,\" whoever \nthey ma.y be, of 1:Jhe LEADER, and he says :-\"Sinoe \ntihen tbe®e have avowed the intoution, a.ncl appa.reutly­\n·still oherish the· idea, of destroying the Claidheami1, \nSol-it.is .and m aki-t1g tlbe LEADER the mouthpiece o.f the \nGaelic Len,gue. lile.nce those atta,cks on the officinI \norga.n, ostensil>ly i,n U1e interests of the public.\" Of \ncom-se ·this ·twaddle need only ho pr.inted to be pro;vecI \nn,?sur~ ;_ hut beyond its inhereint .absUl'dity; it shows a \nd1spos1t10on to see ''plots\" .and \"sohemes\" auid such like, \na disposition, u,nhappily, too prevalenb in this half-slave,. \na,nd over-suspicious coutrtry, and wihich causes a, lot of \navoicln.ble mischief.

First, ·as to the way history ,has of lookrng at \nU1i ngs Irish : -\nAt t,he R evolution, Nationa-list Ireland, was united \nfor Ja.mes. Well, but such unity was labelled \"insular \nsectarianism I\" Tnke another case. When Flood and \nGra.tLa,n quarrelled all the misfortune that followed \nwas J.aicl •to the cha-rge of Irish disunion. ~'hat's a.U \nright pe1·haps, but just about the same t1me, ~wo \nthousa.ncl miles -0r so ftuther west from Engla.ncl, a.midst \ndissensions which tried the pa.tience of the ''Sec-0nd Cin­\ncinnatus,\" \"a giant natio,n spran_g from the w:i,ter.s o~ \nthe Atla.ntic,\" e-tc. !-.nursed to hfo by the a,cc1clent of \nits isolatio-n. Or again, look at this :-In '98 our m­\nveteraLe turbuJe!Ilce was taught a lesson in symmetrica.l \nconducb by enlightened Beresfords with trian~les, _but \na, few yeai·s later the, same tm·bulence, galvamzed mto \none heaving wave by the magic of t,he L iberator's wand, \nis ca-llecl subservience a,nd other nice nam es! And so \non, clown to the other clay, wihen the Parnell split co·n­\nvictecl us finally and irrevocably as inco-rrigible, so mu ch \nso, indeed, that the concord-loving Libera.ls we1e \nshocked at ow· conduct and haven't been t-he bette1· \noi the shock ever since! \nNow let us e,xa.mine one or two histo,ric facts for om~ \nselves. We may pass over the old Celtic times-wh en \nfew of our princes died o-th-er t-han what the wits call \na \" nntur.al\" dea,tih--:meaning a, death not in their beds, \nwith the rerna.rk tha.t other countries were as lorn as was \nIreland wit,h civil strife in those fa.r-off da.ys. Coming \ndown a few centuries, we :have Spencer's opinion of us. \n\"\\Veil, Spencer had .not many so.ft words for us, but his \nworst description, so often quoted; that the Irish were \n\"cruel, bloody, licentious, swea.rers full of dea.dly execu­\nhon,\" refers-wha.t tihe, quo ters genera-Hy forget to \nmention-only to soldiers billeted in time of wa.r. (I \nfancy our prese-nt-da.y T'ommies wouldn'.t consider them­\nselves complimented if they were let off as lighHy as \nthat--aye, in times of peace even). Sir John Davies' \ntestimony is mo-1,e to the-point. \" There is no, nation \nof people under the sl.lJll,\" says Sir John , \" thait do·th \nlove equa-1 a,nd indi:l:fo.rent justice more than the Ir.ish \nor will rest better satisfied with the e-xecution thereof, \nallihouah it be agai-nstl themselves, so they may ha,ve the \nbenefit° and p1·otection of the law.\" ·we might well, pe.r­\nlrn,ps, be,iu· this latter testimony in mind while reading \nthe boisterous record of Irish f.act,ionism in the time of \nthe \"Two liu!!ihs,\" a.nd of Eoghan R.uadh a-ncl so on. \nTh at, togethei'.\" with l'emembering tha.t Engla.nd had her \n\\Va.rs of the, Roses, her Gre.at RebeHion, her Revolution, \nand such like.

As Gilbert \nupho lds the ~heory that the civil pow er should interfere in matters \necclesiastical, a point on which the Independents held decided views, it \nn1::ty be presumed that he professed the opinions of that body at the \ntin1e. He says that the queries ,ve e taken fron1 7 he Stor111i11g of A11ti­\nChr1st, by Christopher Blackwood, a pron1inent Irish Ana baptist, so it \nn1ust have been a 1nen1ber of that denon1ination \\Vho composed and \nhanded round the queries.

Brigadier O’Daly, who led the attack on the | Four Courts, was wounded in that building in Easter Week, 1916, and has been one of the most active spirits in Dublin since the rising. | He commanded the Dublin Guards in the struggle against England. and eommands to-cay when they are pitted against the enemies of the Irish people. : ‘",

Donovan, who, •We believe, is a mighty \" leader \" \nwriter in the Simply Deplo,·able, was aJso at this dinner \nwhen~ \"The King \" was toasted. W~1at in a. S,:,,nz,fy \nDeplorable man is but a, trifle, even if it is that, is flat \ntreason in a. weak-kneed District, Councillor in a corner. \nMessrs. Brayden andl Don ova.n may go to God-Save-the­\nKing dinners, but there is another law for the District \n;~nd municipal Councillors. They must be death-or-glory \nmen when they are in a, corner. We , as our reade)'s \nknow , have no sympathy with fulsome, loya,I a.dd1·essers, \nthough we suspect that if it is weakness that creates a \nfulsome, loyal addresser, it is often wea.kness that creates \nthe toy death-or-glory non-addresser; the one bows to one \nmob, and the other to another; intrinsically, the one is \noften no better than theother. But,a.nywa.y, there ought \nto be the sa.me law for Mr. Brayden a.nd Mr. Donovan \nof t,he Pretmwi as for t-he District Counci,Jlor. \"Honest \n,John,\" who never lifted ,his voice on the floor of the \nBoardroom of the Grea.t Northern RaHway on behalf of \nthe oppressed a.nd. excluded Catholics, but who recently \nga.ve a kick to tho\" under clog,\" the Catholic Association, \nwent clown to Blackrock. He said:-\" The natfonal \nissue, which has ~n rn.ised in connection with this elec­\ntion, is this great question-and it is a great question, \naudit uuderestimated by many-whether the Irish locar \nbodies, whiclt are Na.tionalist, a.re ent-itled, consistently \nwit,h thefr nationality, lo preswt loya.l addresses to the \nSovereign of Eng land, or to a.nyone who represents the· \nBritish Government in this country. 'l'ha.t is a grea.t, \nbroad, naliona,l issue, one which affects the nationa,l cause \nthroughout Ireland.\" Now, why does not \"Honest \nJohn\" go down to Waterford, where Mr . James A . \nPower is M ayor, a.nd talk like that 1 Why does not Mr. \nJohn Redmond , who is Emmpeefor Waterford, speak out \non the question before the Mayora,lty is filled up for an­\nother yeru· 1 \\V.hy are not Mr. Braiyclen, Editor of the \nFreeman , and Mr. Dono va11, of the same sheet, de­\nnounced for attending a God-Save-the-King dinned \nWhy' are not the ga.ng of Dublin journa,lists, who have \nagreed that \" Th e King \" is to be toasted at all formal \noccasions, denounood by \" Honest John 1\" \" Honest \nJohn \" evidently likes to denouuoo a.t a minimum 1;sk. \nIf he denounooct the God-Save-the-King journa,lists, bis \nspeeches might not be reported at greab length; a.nd \nperha.ps Donovan , or Brayden, or Matty Bodkin might \n!ling some ink a.t him in the editoria.I columns of the \nD evlarable. On the face of it, the whole arrangement js \na, fra.ud a.nd a lrnmbug. The Editor of the Fr eem.an and \nother journalists may , wit-h impunity, go to God-Sa.ve-the­\nKin g dinners, a.nd enter into God-Save-the-King com­\npacts, but \" Honest John \" dses in his patriotic wrath if. \na, sma .ll fry iike a. Blackrock village beadle is found wan.t­\ning in a detail of the \" immortal spirit of Irish nationar \nlity.' \n\" Hon est John \" said further:-\" I a.m informed that \nhere the nat.ioua.l candidates, who are being supported by \nLue United N ationa,list body of Blackrock and Booters­\ntown, are pledged to vote steadily against Joya,! addre&..ses \n(hear, hea,r), a,nd on that ground, and on t1rn,t ground \nalone, without reference to their local ,prooodure, they \nhave my hearty support. I have said just now that it is \ne~ntial to the sa.fety of the· national cause in Ireland \ntl111,t the loca.l representative bodies should take a sta.nd \n011 paira.Ilel lines to the N1itiona.J Pa.rty. 'What was the \nrittit,ude of the National Party in this matter! The \nNational Pa.rty m et in Dublin and issued a solemn appea.l \nto aH t:he local bodies in Ireland to sta.nd aloof when the \nSovereign of England visit,ed this country; a.ncl the Na.­\nLional Party stood a,loof itself on the occasion of the Coro­\nnation and refused, in any way, to recognise that event \nor the visit of the King to this country; and the National \nOrganisa.tion acted in t,hjs matter in accord with the Na­\ntional Party in Pa,rliament.\" We hope tha,t-\" Honest \n,John\" will lose no time in going clow n to \\¥aterford, ,i,nd \nhe mia.ht induce his colleague, the member for tha.t. place \n- M/ John Redmond-to go along with him.

Bra.yden, the \nEditor of t,he truly nationa.J Freeman, was at the recent \nGod-Save-the-King dinner of so-called Irish journalists \nwho a.re members of the British Institute of Journa.lists. \nMr. R. Donovan, who, •We believe, is a mighty \" leader \" \nwriter in the Simply Deplo,·able, was aJso at this dinner \nwhen~ \"The King \" was toasted. W~1at in a. S,:,,nz,fy \nDeplorable man is but a, trifle, even if it is that, is flat \ntreason in a. weak-kneed District, Councillor in a corner. \nMessrs. Brayden andl Don ova.n may go to God-Save-the­\nKing dinners, but there is another law for the District \n;~nd municipal Councillors. They must be death-or-glory \nmen when they are in a, corner. We , as our reade)'s \nknow , have no sympathy with fulsome, loya,I a.dd1·essers, \nthough we suspect that if it is weakness that creates a \nfulsome, loyal addresser, it is often wea.kness that creates \nthe toy death-or-glory non-addresser; the one bows to one \nmob, and the other to another; intrinsically, the one is \noften no better than theother. But,a.nywa.y, there ought \nto be the sa.me law for Mr. Brayden a.nd Mr. Donovan \nof t,he Pretmwi as for t-he District Counci,Jlor. \"Honest \n,John,\" who never lifted ,his voice on the floor of the \nBoardroom of the Grea.t Northern RaHway on behalf of \nthe oppressed a.nd. excluded Catholics, but who recently \nga.ve a kick to tho\" under clog,\" the Catholic Association, \nwent clown to Blackrock. He said:-\" The natfonal \nissue, which has ~n rn.ised in connection with this elec­\ntion, is this great question-and it is a great question, \naudit uuderestimated by many-whether the Irish locar \nbodies, whiclt are Na.tionalist, a.re ent-itled, consistently \nwit,h thefr nationality, lo preswt loya.l addresses to the \nSovereign of Eng land, or to a.nyone who represents the· \nBritish Government in this country. 'l'ha.t is a grea.t, \nbroad, naliona,l issue, one which affects the nationa,l cause \nthroughout Ireland.\" Now, why does not \"Honest \nJohn\" go down to Waterford, where Mr . James A . \nPower is M ayor, a.nd talk like that 1 Why does not Mr. \nJohn Redmond , who is Emmpeefor Waterford, speak out \non the question before the Mayora,lty is filled up for an­\nother yeru· 1 \\V.hy are not Mr. Braiyclen, Editor of the \nFreeman , and Mr. Dono va11, of the same sheet, de­\nnounced for attending a God-Save-the-King dinned \nWhy' are not the ga.ng of Dublin journa,lists, who have \nagreed that \" Th e King \" is to be toasted at all formal \noccasions, denounood by \" Honest John 1\" \" Honest \nJohn \" evidently likes to denouuoo a.t a minimum 1;sk. \nIf he denounooct the God-Save-the-King journa,lists, bis \nspeeches might not be reported at greab length; a.nd \nperha.ps Donovan , or Brayden, or Matty Bodkin might \n!ling some ink a.t him in the editoria.I columns of the \nD evlarable. On the face of it, the whole arrangement js \na, fra.ud a.nd a lrnmbug. The Editor of the Fr eem.an and \nother journalists may , wit-h impunity, go to God-Sa.ve-the­\nKin g dinners, a.nd enter into God-Save-the-King com­\npacts, but \" Honest John \" dses in his patriotic wrath if. \na, sma .ll fry iike a. Blackrock village beadle is found wan.t­\ning in a detail of the \" immortal spirit of Irish nationar \nlity.' \n\" Hon est John \" said further:-\" I a.m informed that \nhere the nat.ioua.l candidates, who are being supported by \nLue United N ationa,list body of Blackrock and Booters­\ntown, are pledged to vote steadily against Joya,! addre&..ses \n(hear, hea,r), a,nd on that ground, and on t1rn,t ground \nalone, without reference to their local ,prooodure, they \nhave my hearty support. I have said just now that it is \ne~ntial to the sa.fety of the· national cause in Ireland \ntl111,t the loca.l representative bodies should take a sta.nd \n011 paira.Ilel lines to the N1itiona.J Pa.rty. 'What was the \nrittit,ude of the National Party in this matter! The \nNational Pa.rty m et in Dublin and issued a solemn appea.l \nto aH t:he local bodies in Ireland to sta.nd aloof when the \nSovereign of England visit,ed this country; a.ncl the Na.­\nLional Party stood a,loof itself on the occasion of the Coro­\nnation and refused, in any way, to recognise that event \nor the visit of the King to this country; and the National \nOrganisa.tion acted in t,hjs matter in accord with the Na­\ntional Party in Pa,rliament.\" We hope tha,t-\" Honest \n,John\" will lose no time in going clow n to \\¥aterford, ,i,nd \nhe mia.ht induce his colleague, the member for tha.t. place \n- M/ John Redmond-to go along with him.

If \nthe preserviilg of the 11ta.t1111 quo i-s the only aJ·gumont in \nfavour of the retention of the Briti&h imported auditors, \nthe case a,ga.inst those who take their stand upon the Irish \npla.t(orm is wen.k, indeed. \\~7ere this stat11.s qu.o position \ntaken up genernlly, then farewell t,o revival in any de· \npartment of Irish life. However , we have no doubt tha.t \nthe spirit a.t present a.uima.ti-ng some of the shareholders \nand customers of the ba,nk is oile tha.t will not be easily \nex,bingu.ishecl.

The proposed change, \nit is well to poiilt out, ca-ililOt for a rnomeilt be construed \niilto a reflection on the management of the bank ,-a \nrna.ilagemeilt that deserves ailcl receives the highest credit \nfor the great success t,hat, has a.tteilded .it. The Compa .ily \nActs, very properly, provide t,ha,t the appointment of \nauditors is Oile solely for the sha-reholders; the responsi­\nbility fork is theirs, a-ncl not t-he BoaJ·d's. It is the duty \nof the auditors il0t tci interfere with the maJiagemeilt. \nbut to audit and investigate the Accounts as presented \nby t,he directors. It; would, therefore, be absurd ailcl im­\np~oper for t-he directors· to-dii·ectly or indirectly- ta.Jee \npart iil, or me their influence in connection wit,h, the \nappointmen .t of a,uditocs. \nThe sy1labus of DunJea-ry Feis, which will be held Oil \nSt. Patrick's Day, will be published· in our ne.xt isst~2. \nOur congratulations to Dr . Mc\\Va .lter, who, we \nhea.r, as we geL ready for press, headed tho poll \nin the North City Wa ,rd, Dublin. Dr. McWa ,lter stuck \nto his guns at the Catholic Association when the bigots \nbegan to lie and rave, and the tame Papists shivered \nin· their skins. Tho a.ddr%'S from ,him to the electol\"s \n(:hat .appeared in our la-st issue was .an outspoken, and \nmanly Oile. Opposite the side hea,ding \" Catholic \nAssociation,\" he stated in t,hat address :-\"Whilst the \ninfluences of Freemasonr y continue Lo ha,ve such effect \nin cxcludino- Catholics from the better positions in \nRailways, B -anks, and other Boa.rcls, I judge it a. \nnecessity to have some sort of a Catholic Association to \ndefend their rights. If it is found possible to organise \na. new Association und<ir more favoul'able auspices it \nshall comnmncl my humble service.\" And now ho is \n;it the head of Lhe Poll. \nThere are ma .ny reasons for conclu.ding that we have \nroached a period of reaction in favour of the OaLholic \nc:mse of Tolerance, Just,ice a,nd Fair Play, of w\"!1ich \nthe LEADER has bee•n, through fair weathe1· aild foul, the \nchief idvocate in the press. We loo]i: upon Dr. \nMia W' alte,r's election as more than a signa,l a,nc] descrv<?d \ncomp.liment 1:° ~is own _wort_h; we look u1~on i_t. as \nthrowing a s1gmfica11t side light on the pttbhc attitude \ntowards the fight for justice to Catholics ;which we h:we \nwaged so doggedly and so long in spite of a.II kinds of \ndiscouragements. \nCORRESPONDENCE. \nRAILWAYS AND FrsH. \nA Mrs . Winifred O'Brien, f1Shbuyer, Arklow, wm, \nso enterprising as to place a special agent at Howth \nto supply orders for her. On Tuesday, 18th Oc­\ntober last, her agent consigned at Howth 5 barrels of \nmadcerel to a. customer at Wa.terforcl. The fish were \ndespatched, it is believed, by the 10.55 a.m. tr.a.in from \nIlowth Oil tha,t clay. Th ey did not, however, reach \n·waterford till 'l'huraclay, the 20th October, and were \nthen in an unsa,lea.ble condition, n-ncl had to be sold for \nma.uure. \"On a claim being sent to the Grea,t Northern \nR:tilway Compa -ny as being t,he company by whom the \nfish were consigned, tha.t company refused to pa,y the \nclaim. Theil' goods mann.ger, writing from B elfast l!nder \nelate 14th January, states that-\" Tho fish got the ordi­\nnary goocl,s tra-in service from Ilowth to \"IVa.terford, but \nif your client wanted them delivered iil ·waterford on the \n19th October (i.e., tho following day), she should have \ninstructed her agent to forward them by passenger train. \nAs Waterford is a, statioil on tho Great SoutJhern and \n·wes tern Railwa,y, wo did wha;t was perfectly proper in \nhandiilg over to the latter company at Duhliil.\" I must \nt,herefore roopectfully decliile to eiltertain aily claim in \nt-he matter.\" \n\\Ve ilow have it officia.Jly that it ta-kes tw o who le days \nto get fish from Howth to Waterford by the Great Sou­\nthern a.ud ,~·estern R a-ilway's goods train. It would be \niuteresting to know wheil the \\Vaterforcl fish would have \nre.ached their destination if consigned by the Dublin a.ncl \nWicklo,'1 Railway, which now nm s to \"IVaterford, and I \ninvite the mailager of that company to give us some in­\nformation on the poiut. \nThe Groat Northern Railway manag er's suggestion: \nthaL w e should have cOilfilgiled by passenger traiu is in­\nstrucbi ve. Railway companies always wailt fish sent b)r \npassenger tra-in, at passenger rates, of course. But the-se­\npassenger i-a,tes are so exorbitant that they leave the \nconsignors no profit, and so kill trade. \nFrom the return of tho Boa-rd of Tracie just pt\\blished \nit appea~s that the tal,e of fish iil Scotland last year was \nseven aud a half millioil huildredweights, while the take \nin Irelailcl was only a quarter of a million. Considoriilg \nthat the sea coast of Irela-nd is much larger than Scot­\nJ.a.ud, the difference is startling. \"When we Jiild, how­\ne~er, that the largest ra-ilway compa -ny iil Ireland ta.kes \ntwo days to carry fish a little over 100 miles, the alarming \ncli1Ierence between the fishing return of ScotJaucl aild Ire· \nland seems capa,ble of explanation. \nThe question of the East Coast Fisheries is exercising \nthe public m ind a.t preseilt, and we a-re promised legisla,. \ntioil Qll the matter. Let us hope that somet11ing ma y be \ndone to improve the so-called facilities of transit, which \nw e have at preseilt, a11d enable buyers of commodities, \nsuch as fish, t.o put their wa.res on the mM·ket before they \nbecom e unsa.Jea,ble. • GEORGE F.

On the sug­\n.gestion of Sir Thomas · Esmoncle the following resolu­\ntion was adopted :-That the Irish people ought, to be \n:a free people, with the natura.J right to govern them­\n.selves. That no Parliament is oompetenL to ma .ke laws \nfor Ireland. except a11 Irisl1 Pai·lia,ment sitting in Ire­\nfand.

Council, also that Rural and Dis-\ntrict Oouncil~ should be invited to send one delegate, \nea,ch, to the Counoil.

If \nthe preserviilg of the 11ta.t1111 quo i-s the only aJ·gumont in \nfavour of the retention of the Briti&h imported auditors, \nthe case a,ga.inst those who take their stand upon the Irish \npla.t(orm is wen.k, indeed. \\~7ere this stat11.s qu.o position \ntaken up genernlly, then farewell t,o revival in any de· \npartment of Irish life. However , we have no doubt tha.t \nthe spirit a.t present a.uima.ti-ng some of the shareholders \nand customers of the ba,nk is oile tha.t will not be easily \nex,bingu.ishecl.

The Compa .ily \nActs, very properly, provide t,ha,t the appointment of \nauditors is Oile solely for the sha-reholders; the responsi­\nbility fork is theirs, a-ncl not t-he BoaJ·d's. It is the duty \nof the auditors il0t tci interfere with the maJiagemeilt. \nbut to audit and investigate the Accounts as presented \nby t,he directors. It; would, therefore, be absurd ailcl im­\np~oper for t-he directors· to-dii·ectly or indirectly- ta.Jee \npart iil, or me their influence in connection wit,h, the \nappointmen .t of a,uditocs. \nThe sy1labus of DunJea-ry Feis, which will be held Oil \nSt. Patrick's Day, will be published· in our ne.xt isst~2. \nOur congratulations to Dr . Mc\\Va .lter, who, we \nhea.r, as we geL ready for press, headed tho poll \nin the North City Wa ,rd, Dublin. Dr. McWa ,lter stuck \nto his guns at the Catholic Association when the bigots \nbegan to lie and rave, and the tame Papists shivered \nin· their skins. Tho a.ddr%'S from ,him to the electol\"s \n(:hat .appeared in our la-st issue was .an outspoken, and \nmanly Oile. Opposite the side hea,ding \" Catholic \nAssociation,\" he stated in t,hat address :-\"Whilst the \ninfluences of Freemasonr y continue Lo ha,ve such effect \nin cxcludino- Catholics from the better positions in \nRailways, B -anks, and other Boa.rcls, I judge it a. \nnecessity to have some sort of a Catholic Association to \ndefend their rights. If it is found possible to organise \na. new Association und<ir more favoul'able auspices it \nshall comnmncl my humble service.\" And now ho is \n;it the head of Lhe Poll. \nThere are ma .ny reasons for conclu.ding that we have \nroached a period of reaction in favour of the OaLholic \nc:mse of Tolerance, Just,ice a,nd Fair Play, of w\"!1ich \nthe LEADER has bee•n, through fair weathe1· aild foul, the \nchief idvocate in the press. We loo]i: upon Dr. \nMia W' alte,r's election as more than a signa,l a,nc] descrv<?d \ncomp.liment 1:° ~is own _wort_h; we look u1~on i_t. as \nthrowing a s1gmfica11t side light on the pttbhc attitude \ntowards the fight for justice to Catholics ;which we h:we \nwaged so doggedly and so long in spite of a.II kinds of \ndiscouragements. \nCORRESPONDENCE. \nRAILWAYS AND FrsH. \nA Mrs . Winifred O'Brien, f1Shbuyer, Arklow, wm, \nso enterprising as to place a special agent at Howth \nto supply orders for her. On Tuesday, 18th Oc­\ntober last, her agent consigned at Howth 5 barrels of \nmadcerel to a. customer at Wa.terforcl. The fish were \ndespatched, it is believed, by the 10.55 a.m. tr.a.in from \nIlowth Oil tha,t clay. Th ey did not, however, reach \n·waterford till 'l'huraclay, the 20th October, and were \nthen in an unsa,lea.ble condition, n-ncl had to be sold for \nma.uure. \"On a claim being sent to the Grea,t Northern \nR:tilway Compa -ny as being t,he company by whom the \nfish were consigned, tha.t company refused to pa,y the \nclaim. Theil' goods mann.ger, writing from B elfast l!nder \nelate 14th January, states that-\" Tho fish got the ordi­\nnary goocl,s tra-in service from Ilowth to \"IVa.terford, but \nif your client wanted them delivered iil ·waterford on the \n19th October (i.e., tho following day), she should have \ninstructed her agent to forward them by passenger train. \nAs Waterford is a, statioil on tho Great SoutJhern and \n·wes tern Railwa,y, wo did wha;t was perfectly proper in \nhandiilg over to the latter company at Duhliil.\" I must \nt,herefore roopectfully decliile to eiltertain aily claim in \nt-he matter.\" \n\\Ve ilow have it officia.Jly that it ta-kes tw o who le days \nto get fish from Howth to Waterford by the Great Sou­\nthern a.ud ,~·estern R a-ilway's goods train. It would be \niuteresting to know wheil the \\Vaterforcl fish would have \nre.ached their destination if consigned by the Dublin a.ncl \nWicklo,'1 Railway, which now nm s to \"IVaterford, and I \ninvite the mailager of that company to give us some in­\nformation on the poiut. \nThe Groat Northern Railway manag er's suggestion: \nthaL w e should have cOilfilgiled by passenger traiu is in­\nstrucbi ve. Railway companies always wailt fish sent b)r \npassenger tra-in, at passenger rates, of course. But the-se­\npassenger i-a,tes are so exorbitant that they leave the \nconsignors no profit, and so kill trade. \nFrom the return of tho Boa-rd of Tracie just pt\\blished \nit appea~s that the tal,e of fish iil Scotland last year was \nseven aud a half millioil huildredweights, while the take \nin Irelailcl was only a quarter of a million. Considoriilg \nthat the sea coast of Irela-nd is much larger than Scot­\nJ.a.ud, the difference is startling. \"When we Jiild, how­\ne~er, that the largest ra-ilway compa -ny iil Ireland ta.kes \ntwo days to carry fish a little over 100 miles, the alarming \ncli1Ierence between the fishing return of ScotJaucl aild Ire· \nland seems capa,ble of explanation. \nThe question of the East Coast Fisheries is exercising \nthe public m ind a.t preseilt, and we a-re promised legisla,. \ntioil Qll the matter. Let us hope that somet11ing ma y be \ndone to improve the so-called facilities of transit, which \nw e have at preseilt, a11d enable buyers of commodities, \nsuch as fish, t.o put their wa.res on the mM·ket before they \nbecom e unsa.Jea,ble. • GEORGE F.

A t-rainino- in domestic \neconom_y, a_s t,he idea.I of a girl's ecluca.tion, is supplant,ing \ntbe :l!;lthet1c refii_iemeuts of the past.

But w hen all is \nsaid, .nuns, i.u my opinion, cannot be quite excuS€:d for \nha.ving yielded to tho prevaa.ling disposition as much as \nthey ha.ve yielded. In saying this, I a.m expecting more \nfrom them than from othei-s; I judge them by a, higher \n.standard. But tha.t admission does not jusLify tlieir \ncritics, because a.t the woi-st they ha.ve m erely more or \nJes:; neglected a-n importa.ut element in educa,tion which \nwa; equa.liy neglected in non-Ca.tholic a,nd secular schools. \nYet, .since t-he cry for dom est-ic econoiny ha,s been raised \nit ha.s grown into extrava.gance with som e, :tncl those who \nare always ready to discredit co1w ent3 instinctively turned \ntheir crit,icism exclusively on nuns a,s if they aJoue. or \nchiefly, 'had neglected t,he practica,l and t-he useful in the \neducation they impMi:ed. During t,he Irish T imes epi­\ndemic, w hen the \"Roma n Catholic farmer \" from KilJaloe \nrelieved his soul of Ca.non M 'Ineruey's enormities, other \n\" R oman Catholic\" correspondents told us of Catholics \nw ho ha,ve decided to rema.i11 single raLher than jeopardise \ntheir happiness with a, Catholic wife who could not super­\nintend their kitchen on the arrangem ents of their home. \nWe wern, of course, expected to suppose that those nn­\nna.m ecl heroes of thefa.ith, fa.iliug to find a suita,ble Catho­\nlic w ife, wo uld ra.the1· bear the ma rtyrdom of single \nblesseclne~s th,in propose for a, P rotesta,nt la;:ly and em­\nba,-k on a, m ixed nia.rria,ge, or tha.t it was not the case that \nthey proposed for both and were accepted by neither, \nI ba.ve no wish to ma.ke invidious com parisons in other \nrespect·&, but my experience bot-h here and in Englam l \nhas impre~ecl me that in the sphere of domesti~ economy, \nCatholic and non-Catholic housekeepei-s, those who have \nbeen educated in convents, and those who have bee11 \neduca.l'ecl elsewhe re, ta.king them grade by grade in the \nsocial sca,le, have about equa,I m erit. A lady who w as· \neducated in one of the highest P1·ote,3t.1,nt educational \nesta.blishments in t'his country told me la.tel_y that, her \nfa.mily lrn.viug suffered reverses of fortune, she had, on \nleaving sohool, to nia.k-e a livelihood fo1· he1-self, and Lha.t \nthough she had learned painting and music, could play \non two 01· three instruments, she wa s utterly ignorant of \nhousekeeping, and found herself without a,ny equipment \nfor the battle of life.

This George Lysaght was, I believe, the man \n,vho ultimately inherited the main portion of the old man's means. \nFrom the context we can infer that he, like his cousin, Thomas Lysaght, \nwent to Spain ,vith great expectations, to seek his fortune under the \nregis of his grand-uncle, the admiral. At any rate, George Lysaght, . . \non his return to Ireland, became so ,vealthy according to pO'pular belief \nthat he was kno,vn in later years as Seo1f1re-c.n-61fl, (t'.e, \"George of \nthe Go ld,\") _wealth, ho,vever, bringing him and his family no luck.

By a second marriage with \nhis own first cousin, a sister of Frank ruadh TJysaght, of Moy Castle, near \nLehinch-the man whose transportation for trea~on in 1799, is said ~o \nhave suggested to the poet Campbell the idea of the \"Exile of Erin.\"­\nGeorge was father of Christopher Lysaght, of Ardnacullia (Woodmount), \nnear Ennisty_mon, High Sheriff of Clare in 1803.

Rotunda on Saturday, \nwe sho_uld be compelled to admit that the influence of \nthe League is dimini~hiug instead qf increasing in and \naround the metropol~s. It ~as a very poor Feis, no \nmatter from what pomt of view we regard it. In the \nfirst place, the attendance of the general public was \n• very small, and this remark applies equally to the day \nproceedings and to the .Cuirm Ceoil in the evening. \nApart from the competitors and officials there were \nscarcely a hundred people present at the competitions, \nand I have never seen a smaller gathering at a Ouirm \nCeoil in the Round Room, except, perhaps, the audience \nthat used to attend the performances of the Oireachtas \nChoir. This is unsatisfactory, for it cannot fail to leave \nthe committee with a considerable balance to the wrong \nside when the accounts of the Feis are closed.\" \nHappily for himself these notes are written by \"An Lcv­\nrecha:1rn,\" and we all know that a Levrechawn is not the \neasiest thing in the world to catch. In the days of our \nextrelI!e youth we made many a fruitless search in the \nearly hours of the morning for a Levrecha,11,n. The \nstreet blackguards of the Gaelic League who remain \nundenounced by the E -xecutive will have their work cut \nout for them if they wish to \" hold up \" a Leprecha.itn \nfor his critical note. Catch your Lcvrecliaim before \nyou h~ld him up. \n'\\Ve received-no invitation to the P e1·s, and so cannot \n-speak of it from personal observation. In view of the \nnotes we have quoted from the lndevenclent and from \nthe Weekly Freeman, it is perhaps only fair to g_ive t~e \nfollowing from the official organ : -\" The D~bhn F~is \nproves amongst other t~ings that the ~eague m Dubhn \nis very much alive,-ahve not _merely m the se~1se that \nit ca-n astonish the public by a huge demonstration once \na year, but in the sense tha~ it is working all the \nwhile, that it is actually producmg spea~ers_ and readers \nand writers of the language.\" As the JUmor reporters \nsay, comment is· needless. The organ that tapped t~e \ncriminal street blackguards on the. back and t~at is \nlikewise a \"confrere \" of the official organ, said: -\n\" No one who attended the Dublin Feis last Sat~tr?ay \ncould fail to be struck with the improvement exh~bited \n• in practically all the competitions.'' An~ agam : -\n\" The concert at night was one of th~ best Insh concerts \nrecently given in Dublin. The audience was large, ~ut \nit should have been even larger.\" Our re'.1-ders, with­\nout any suggestion from us, can make then· own com­\nments. The fight before the League three _months ago \nwas enough to try the strongest !1eart ; smce ~he~ a \nweak Executive has in a sense alhed the Orga~usat~on \nwith street blackguardism, and the consequ~ut situation \nis anything but encouraging. '!'he ~xecutiv~ has _been \ntried and has been found wantrng ; 1t remams for the \n.6.r-o fe1r to take the League out of the gutter. \nvVe have received cheque for £3 for the ~anguage \nFund from Father Fuller, P.P., of ~ 'allybumon, Co. \nK .

Ou . the order, after paying our \nworkers a living wage, we would have a. profit of two­\npence, while the \"pioneers of the Industrial Move­\nment,'' as we learned from their own representative, \nwould net a profit of twelve shillings! \n\" It is extortion like this that is crippling home trade, \nand until the Irish people rise up in rebellion against it, \nand the Irish manufacturers combine to devise some \nmeans to compel the' retailer to dispose of Irish-made \ngoods at a reasonable margin of profit, we fear that Irish \nmanufacture in this ~mpoverished country must take a \nbac~ seat,-Yours faithfully, \"F?;' the Dunl~ ~ry \nHosiery Co., T.

Again, while they are being taught, the philan­\nthropists supplying the money regardless of result, the \nproduce is placed on the market, through private in­\nfluence, much to the detriment of the legitimate and, in \nmany cases, struggling manufacturer and trader. \n\"vVe would like to know how m any of these so-called \ncharity firms or associations have been started in Ireland \nduring the last few years, some even und er royal patron­\nage, and after surviving for a short time, cutting down \nprices, as profit was not their object, by temporary re­\nlief remain in existence now, after, perhaps, in Na .ny \ncases, doing a little good for the time being in their \nown immediate .locality; but, in reality, leaving the \nmatter worse than they got it, having compelled the \nheavily-taxed manufacturer to reduce his prices. \nTrusting you will succeed in your honest and sensible \nexertions to revive and keep in the front Irish-manufac­\ntured goods, as all we as Irish manufacturers wan£, is \na fair field and no favour, and every Irish man, woman, \nand child to help us by buying our 'goods.-W .. e are, \nyours faithfully, H .

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

One of the \"improvements' most actively opposd by the Catholic leople, and that which the Americans find almost. impossible to acclimatise, is that of co-education. Thre miglt. be mauy quotations to show what is the Aenca .n op1111011 about he schools, but perhaps a few will suffice. \" Many parents fear to send their children to the public schools, ,ind yet it is not proven that the m?ral tone of most private schools is better.\" A com­ mit.tee of Massachusetts,s la.dies made ii renort declarinn\" that the teachers a.!most universally compl;iu of the pr:. valence of lying, stea.ling, profanity and impurity amongst their scholars. A writer in the Al.lanl-ic, for lIay, 1894, says that in a large class of young women gradua,t,es of public schools in one of our older States, all but two confessed to hcarino-in their early life in t-he public schools what they cold never forget, though no words_ could express the longing they felt to blot it from theu- memory.

These words of Dr. Foley make known to the Irish people the real issue at stake in the battle against \"the New Rule.\" There has been a good deal said about the hardship that would be done to the teachers, should this rule be -put into eJl'ect. Scarcely any proposal can be made for the public good nowadays that does not carry with it some damage to individual interests. The rail­ ways, tram-cars, electric lighting were advantages that all entailed hardships on large sections of the community. The closing of the police barracks and the operation of the Land Act--both very beneficial to the community­ will throw a large number of persons out of employment. Yet, if a scheme is manifestly for the public good, the individual interest must be sacrificed. Sal,us populi si1,11rema lex. In the present circumstances, if the amal­ gamation of the schools were a benefit, any fairminded government should compensate men who were thus un­ expectedly and undeservedly thrown out of a career they had chosen, relying upon the stability of affairs, and popular opinion should see to the making of this com- pensation. .

A great interest \n, 1s taken in the industrial revival, and the industrial ex­\nhibition which will be held at, the \\Vexford Feis at \nNew · Ross promises to be a, o-reat success. Father \nIHai·pur prdposecl a resolution calling upon public bodies \nto .:.Support Irish manufacture whether clearer or not \nthan competing goods. \\Ve read in a loc:il report, \n\"';I.'hat, he said, was a very strong proposition, and \noppose? to THE LEADER policy.\" \\\\Te ll, it certainly is; \nan~ 3:nsh go?ds a.t any price is certainly ,t \"strong\" pro­\npositiou. If Father Harpur who, we believe is young \nand enthusiastic, if -not, exactlv shrewd and level­\n·headed- these qualities -will no ~loubt come with ex­\nperience-if Father !Elarpur will read the letters from \nleading manufacturers in last week's LEADER, and in \nthe current issue, he will find- we feel sure such a \nsweeping enthusiast will reinain loya.lly unconvinced­\nthat his \"strong '' proposition is not only opposed to \nthe LEADER policy, but opposed to the views of tiie \nmanuia ,oturers whose views are set forth in the LEADER. \nThe \" strong \" proposition was, of course, objected to, \n-and t'he result was that the followinO' resolution was \nad?pted :-\" That we call upon all the °'public boards· in \nthis country to make contracts only with bona fide Irish \nfirms, and use only Irish manufactured goods except \nwhere reasonable necessity compels them to do other­\nwise.\" Certainly \" reasonable necessity \" is au emi­\nnently diplomatic qualification, and every one can in­\nterpret it at 'his own sweet will. \nThe LEADER incident, or rather tho fact that the \nmajority of the Executive Committee at the last meet­\ning refused to denounce the criminal conduct of street \nblackguards came on for discussion. vVe quote from a \nlocal press report : -\" Father Kehoe moved a resolution \nreceived from one of the county branches of the league \nexpressing di_sappointment at the attitude of the central \nbranch of the league in not repudiating the disgraceful \ntreatment meted out to the editor of T'HE LEADER at the \nrecent language procession held i.n Dublin. Au appeal \nhad been made to the Gaelic League authorities in \nDublin, said \"Father Kehoe , t,o repudiate all connection \nwith THE LEADER · incident, but they had refused to \ndo so. He thought tlrn,t this meeting should repudiate \nthe action of the individuals in Dublin for the dis­\ngraceful manner in which they conducted them­\nselves towards the Editor of the LEADER-a man \nwho had done so much for the advancement of \nthe Gaelic League. He thought it was a scandal and \na shame that a man like Mr. Moran should be treated \nin such a disgraceful and undignified manner on such \nan occasion in Dublin-a man, he said, he liked better \nfor the support that he had given the Gaelic movement \nthan any of them.'' \nWe_ read th3:t. Father Harpur, whose \"strong\" in­\ndustrial propos1t1on was opposed to tho LEADER policy, \n\" argued contra.'' He held that the promoters of tho \nprocession were entitled to act as they liked with regard \nto that procession, and allow into it or _put out of it \nwhom they choose. Father Harpur in his enthusiasm \nevidently forgot that even the Executive declared that \nthe street blackguards acted without authority! And \n• subsequently when Fatl1er McCormack remarked that \none of the roughs wore a badge, Father Harpur who had \npreviously objected to Father Keogh's resolution on the \nground that the authorities of the procession could \nallow in or put out whom they wished, shifted his \nground and replied that \"it was explained that the \nperson ~n question wore a badge held over from last \nyear's procession.'' Who told Father Harpur that 1 \nHas it been officially stated Did one of the street \nblackguards who laid contribution on the services of a \n\"minion \" of the law in the shape of a policeman, \nmasquerade as a steward with a bogus badge, and yet \nare the authorities of the League afraid to denounce \nauch str~et scound1·els 1 However, the question whether \n. the badge was last year's or this year's is not very im­\nportant; the fellow had a badge anyway, and he and his \ntollow street rouglis have not been denounced by a \nmajority at the last meeting of the ~xecutive Com­\nmittee.

That line of teaching was practically originated in the States and was \"boomed,\" to use an Americanism, for all it was worth. Co-education, that is, the mingling of the sexes in the school-room, is also au American idea. The movement began in Ohio in 1833, and since then has spread with great rapidity. At present, in the State elementary education the general practice is to have boys and girls taught in the same classes. In fact, wherever the opposite is found there are special condi­ tions such as location or structure of school building trnt prevent its adoption. Of a total of 6,005 State high schools, 98 per cent. are mixed, and even of private schools there are 56 per cent. worked on t.he same plan.

I clo not think \nthat the principles or the practice of a country like \nthat is to be copied in chaste and Catholic Ireland. \nI _'do not say there is a strict nexus between \n~he two facts, but there is certainly matter for thought \nIn the fact that the land- Scotland-that has the most \ncomplete system of mixed education has also an excep­\ntionally high record of immorality. Even suppose that \nthere is no _direct relation, still the opinion of people \nwhose practice works out.. so badly is not worth much to \na moralist; in fact, if anything, such statistics would \nmake hi~1 very chary of imitation in any point where \nthe relat10n of the sexes was concerned. \nThe _overwhe~ming verdict of the worid is against co­\neducat1011. If one reads the educational reports the fact \ns~an~s out that there is a consensus amongst ecluca­\nt10111sts and parents that co-education is not to be \nfavoured. In England, in the secondary schools where, \n\"!1P to t~e present, public _opinion has been able to assert \nitsel_f without officialism forcing its fads on the people \nas Ill elementary schools, the common sense of the \npeople has decided in favour of the separation of the \ns~xes'. Any experiments in the direction of: co-ecluca­\ntio~. have ~eceived scant encouragement. In the \nBritish colomes the prevailing method is the non-mixed \nschool. In. Australia the lloys and girls are taught \ns~parately un!ess when exigencies of income or situa­\nt10n pr~vcnt-it.

There is scarcely \nau assizes that does not fm·nish a melancholy proof of \nhow badly it works out for moraJity to have· grown \nteachers engaged in daily and inti.mate intercourse with \ngrown pupils of the opposite sex. A1l for the pupils, \nHt·. Moorhouse, the Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, said \nthat the parents of s·uch children are passing them \nthrough the fire to the Moloch of immorality. Judge \nRogen said that the populatio_ns ~uilt up from these \nschools would be wholly wantrng rn the moral char­\nacter which belongs to a Christian people. Judge \n:Forbes declared that these schools were producing \ncriminals, and Judge Ducker called them hot-beds \nof immora.lity. These are very hard nuts for the \nadvocates of amalgamation. In France the· law 1·e­\nquil'es that every commune having over 500· inhabitants \nmust have separate schools for girls. That would ' \nme .an to have schools where the average attendance of \npupils would not be more than 60 all told both boys \nand girls. In secondary education, separate education \nis the universal rule. In Germany mixed schools are \ntolerated when the necessity of mixed schools or no • • \nschools confronts the locality, and only on these con­\nditions. In all the continental countries and even in \nthe colonies that have sprung from them, if the Catho­\nlic religion is dominant, separate schools are the in­\nvariable rule. Some Protestant cour;itries li~e Norway \nand Sweden have been experimenting, but the general \nreport is that no great success has followed, and evell \nthough there may be flattering reports in all these \nmatters, I maintain that we cannot accept the verdict· \nof non-Catholic educationists ou a matter so closely \nconcerning the morality of our people. \nThe case then may be summed up thus :-The \nNational Commissioners, or I should say more cor­\nrectly, the educational experts of the .Board a1:e ma .king \nan effort to introduce co-education of the sexes. The \nmethod is abhorrent to the instincts of the Catholic \nworld as evidenced by the fact that no Catholic country \napprove~ of it o_r adopts it. The method, judged by \nresults rn Amenca, England and Scotland, has come \nunder the gravest suspicion as furnishing an easy gra­\ndient on the course to immorality. There is no nation \nin the world where we have a greater treasure to o-uard \nthan in Ireland. There is no nation where we \n0\nhave \nmore to fear because of the warning proverb \" corruptio,· \noptimi pessima.''

Years \nago, when Irish manufacture was at its lowest ebb, \nIl'ish· farmers purchased certain foreign• and · cross-\n·channel . makers' machines and farm implements. To \ntb:e, present day they stick largely to the same beaten \ntrack, though ' as a -matter of fact there are machinery \nand , implements made in Ireland at the present time \nquite superior. v\\Te have seen our machinery landed \nfrom abroad at Irish Ports to be used on Irish farms. \nthe machines referred to were built at \\V'exford, having \na cross-channel firm's name cast on them. These ma­\nchines ,~ere bought on their merit alone. The same \nbuyers would not purchase with ·the original maker 's \nname on. We believe Irish manufacturers of another \nclass of goods had similar experience. Under such cir­\ncumstances you will readily conceive how difficult it has \nbeen for au Irish manufacturer to keep his head over \nthe water. \\Ve are glad to say, however, that owing \nto the exertions of the LEADER, the ' Irish Industrial \nRevivalists,' the ' Gaelic League,' and the admitted \nsuperiority of the great bulk of Irish-made goods, the \nIrish people are finding out that they have been making \na bad mistake, and it is to be hoped that in due time \nthey will make reparation for their thoughtless action \nin the past that told so much against the prosperity \nof then: country. \n\"We consider it would injure our own industry, even \nthough we m ay be giving better value than outside \ncompetitors, if the view gained any volume that people \nwere expected to pay more for goods in the market be­\ncause they were Irish . \\Ve may add that it is our \nexperience that there will be found in all Ireland but \na very small 1'>ercentage indeed of the public who are \nprepared to pay anything extra for goods because they \nare Irish-made. The vast m ajority of Irish manufac­\nturers only require a fair field and no favour, but Irish \npurchasers, men and w omen, should also do their duty. \nThey must do away with prejudice, rely more on their \nown judgment , and act less on custom, habit or practice. \n\"In conclusion, the following facts point clearly to \nthe want of self-confidence in Irishmen, and their ex­\ntraordinary prejudice in favour of the foreign-made \narticle, more especially if it savours of' Yankee Land '-\n\" Some few years ago, this country was absolutely \nflooded with · American-built bicycles.

Most of the machines collapsed \nbefore the season had run out, and at the present \ntime an American cycle is about as rare in Ireland as \nthe Irish wolf-dog.

One of the \"improvements' most actively \noppos~d by the Catholic }leople, and that which the \nAmericans find almost. impossible to acclimatise, is that \nof co-education. \nTh~re migl~t. be mauy quotations· to show what is the \nA~enca .n op1111011 about ~he schools, but perhaps a few \nwill suffice. \" Many parents fear to send their children \nto the public schools, ,ind yet it is not proven that the \nm?ral tone of most private schools is better.\" A com­\nmit.tee of Massachusett,s la.dies made ii renort declarinn\" \nthat the teachers a.!most universally compl;iu of the pr:. \nvalence of lying, stea.ling, profanity and impurity \namongst their scholars. A writer in the Al.lanl-ic, for \nl\\Iay, 1894, says that in a large class of young women \ngradua,t,es of public schools in one of our older States, \nall but two confessed to hcarino-in their early life in \nt-he public schools what they co~ld never forget, though \nno words_ could express the longing they felt to blot it \nfrom theu- memory. I quote these passages from the \n\" Encyclopcedia of -Social Reforms,\" page 538. \n,vhat C'atholics shoula regard as the prime factor in \nproducing this laxity of morals-the brea.lcing down of \nthat womanly modesty which the saints tell us is the \nbulwark of pm·ity-this cause is bound to operate in \nschools where t,he sexes are in constant and-intimate \nintercourse. \nIn England, 65 per cent. of the elementary schools \nadopt the mixed system; in Scotland, 97 per cent. A s \nto the first of these countries, I have heard it from \npriests that spent some time on the English mi ssion that \nthey used to be mo st careful not to pass ne;ir these \nschools when the pupils emerged for their mid-clay re­\ncreation, or for the return home in the evening. The \nlanguage, the open indecency was so shocking that no \nrespecta.ble person could pass through them without a \nshudder. As to England and the relations of the sexes, \n:I! ,suppose my readers are familiar with Froude 's de­\nscription:-\" Immorality in Hayti is so universal that \nit almost ceases to be a fault, for a fault implies au \nexception, and in Hayti it is the rule. . . . So far, \nthey are no worse than in our own English Islands \nwhere the custom is equally general.\"-\" History of the \nEnglish in the _West-Indies,\" page 344. I clo not think \nthat the principles or the practice of a country like \nthat is to be copied in chaste and Catholic Ireland. \nI _'do not say there is a strict nexus between \n~he two facts, but there is certainly matter for thought \nIn the fact that the land- Scotland-that has the most \ncomplete system of mixed education has also an excep­\ntionally high record of immorality. Even suppose that \nthere is no _direct relation, still the opinion of people \nwhose practice works out.. so badly is not worth much to \na moralist; in fact, if anything, such statistics would \nmake hi~1 very chary of imitation in any point where \nthe relat10n of the sexes was concerned. \nThe _overwhe~ming verdict of the worid is against co­\neducat1011. If one reads the educational reports the fact \ns~an~s out that there is a consensus amongst ecluca­\nt10111sts and parents that co-education is not to be \nfavoured. In England, in the secondary schools where, \n\"!1P to t~e present, public _opinion has been able to assert \nitsel_f without officialism forcing its fads on the people \nas Ill elementary schools, the common sense of the \npeople has decided in favour of the separation of the \ns~xes'. Any experiments in the direction of: co-ecluca­\ntio~. have ~eceived scant encouragement. In the \nBritish colomes the prevailing method is the non-mixed \nschool. In. Australia the lloys and girls are taught \ns~parately un!ess when exigencies of income or situa­\nt10n pr~vcnt-it. As soon, however, as the increase of \n11_opulat1on warrant_s it, the mixed schools two disco11-\ntu.1uecf. '!\"here is nowhere th.at the advocates of the \nmi~ed system have got such disheartening results as \n:~~~•,n!.I~,,rNo TAO'KLE, Flne1t quality, ohe&peat In the Klngdo& \n~•hlnr T kl •••~ibf Tied, 1/4 11er • d~■• Illultrate<t Oatalo,rn~ ill on,,, ,., \nlaohnr, a&' u;pv om!: Qa~;. ~'::ii:: Gu ud Jl'fehlar Taokle JIM•· \nin the la,nd._ of the Southern Oross. There is scarcely \nau assizes that does not fm·nish a melancholy proof of \nhow badly it works out for moraJity to have· grown \nteachers engaged in daily and inti.mate intercourse with \ngrown pupils of the opposite sex. A1l for the pupils, \nHt·. Moorhouse, the Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, said \nthat the parents of s·uch children are passing them \nthrough the fire to the Moloch of immorality. Judge \nRogen said that the populatio_ns ~uilt up from these \nschools would be wholly wantrng rn the moral char­\nacter which belongs to a Christian people. Judge \n:Forbes declared that these schools were producing \ncriminals, and Judge Ducker called them hot-beds \nof immora.lity. These are very hard nuts for the \nadvocates of amalgamation. In France the· law 1·e­\nquil'es that every commune having over 500· inhabitants \nmust have separate schools for girls. That would ' \nme .an to have schools where the average attendance of \npupils would not be more than 60 all told both boys \nand girls. In secondary education, separate education \nis the universal rule. In Germany mixed schools are \ntolerated when the necessity of mixed schools or no • • \nschools confronts the locality, and only on these con­\nditions. In all the continental countries and even in \nthe colonies that have sprung from them, if the Catho­\nlic religion is dominant, separate schools are the in­\nvariable rule. Some Protestant cour;itries li~e Norway \nand Sweden have been experimenting, but the general \nreport is that no great success has followed, and evell \nthough there may be flattering reports in all these \nmatters, I maintain that we cannot accept the verdict· \nof non-Catholic educationists ou a matter so closely \nconcerning the morality of our people. \nThe case then may be summed up thus :-The \nNational Commissioners, or I should say more cor­\nrectly, the educational experts of the .Board a1:e ma .king \nan effort to introduce co-education of the sexes. The \nmethod is abhorrent to the instincts of the Catholic \nworld as evidenced by the fact that no Catholic country \napprove~ of it o_r adopts it. The method, judged by \nresults rn Amenca, England and Scotland, has come \nunder the gravest suspicion as furnishing an easy gra­\ndient on the course to immorality. There is no nation \nin the world where we have a greater treasure to o-uard \nthan in Ireland. There is no nation where we \n0\nhave \nmore to fear because of the warning proverb \" corruptio,· \noptimi pessima.'' Our priests and people should there­\nfore make an united stand because the .fight is not \nmerely one for the teachers and their rio-hts but it \nis clearly a battle for the p~rity of the Ir~h home . \nP.

It \nis manufactured out of a solid piece of yew, is I 2 ¾'. inches high, 4 ,½ \ninches from side to side across the top, and, if perfect, would hold about \na quart. The vessel has a circular base, turned in some sort of lathe, \nwhich measures 4 inches in diameter. The bottom is carefully hollowed \nout to the depth of threequarters of an inch, and has the angle formed \nbetween this hollow and the surface on which the cup stands decorated \nwith a continuous set of oblique notches, producing a simple but pretty \neffect. The circular base, sloping upwards and inwards, is only one inch \nhigh, and is marked with plain incised lines. Unfort:.mately the sleaglzan, \nor turf-spade, cut off nearly the whole of one side of the vessel, and, \nalthough search was made, the missing piece could not be found. The \ncup undoubtedly had been in use for a long time before it was logt in \nthe bog, for it shows unmistakeable signs of having been mended, or \nstrengthened, just above the handle, by a band of some sort, most \nlikely of metal, to fix which two rivet holes were bored on each of its \nsides. It was probably carried full of milk or some other liquor, one \nsummer day long ago, to the workers in Drynagh bog, who forgot it \nwhen returning in the evening, and so in course of time it got covered \nwith the peat. \nIn some respects, I think, this mether is unique-at least I \nknow of no other exactly like it-on account of its great height in \nproportion Lo its width, and also because it has only one small handle; \nfor if it had a second it would most: certainly be found on the opposite \nside, which is fortunately intact. These peculiarities resulted, I am \ninclined to believe, not altogether from choice, but because the maker, in \norder to turn out a vessel of sufficient capacity, was limited in his art by \nthe size and shape of the particular piece of yew he had to work on.

The action \nis stayed now aml t'hen by quaint and ,humorous scenes \nbetwwu the Icing's servrunts after the manner o.f \nShaJcspere, and there are also two scenes where a, woman \nof the Sidhe is int-,rodu.cecl as tempting Brian and his \nson successively to the ignoble ]ifo of unreal ease among \nthe Sid'he. O.ne migl1L possibly construe these' scenes \nas a satire on some of t,he a,ulihors of the literary theatre·, \nbut the general view was tha.t they were somewhat of an \nexcrescence, aud •had better be left out-, of the drama. \nThe play is really made up of ·two parts--BTian and \nGormleith. Both are strongly and sympathetically \ndraw n, but La,dy Gregory ha-s shown herself mercile~ in \nher delineation of the female character. Brian is with \nLady Gregory wha .t Henry V. is with Shakspere-the \nmigh-Ly wa,rrior a,nd the perfect man ; the gi•eat national \na-nd Ohrist-,iau hero. His character is idealised through­\nout/; so much iclea-lised, indeed, that the student o.f his­\ntory maY:, perhaps, find himself a little perplexed.

A!.1 unfair but too prevalent notion that 1Jheir \ncla.i~s to ~refer-e.nce rested lll'ore on patriotio -tthain eco­\nnom1c cons1deratio-ns. If the advocacy of tho ','as good \nand as chea~\" the,ory as the sa,fos~ general principle to \nbe aidoptoo m rega,rd to supportma Irish-made aoods \n. ha.d no other recommonda.tion t,ha,1~ its efficacy ;s an \nargument to destroy this prejudice, it would still have \nmuch justificaition. With regard to bheoo Irish-ma.de \numbrel-las,. it is claimed that in asking a, preference for \nt,hem as Insh ma:irnfa.cture, Messrs. Smyth and Son only \ndo so ou the basis that they are a,t least equal in price \nan? quaJity to those imported. TiJ.1e mak ers lay stress on \ntins fea.t,ure, as t,hey ha,ve found prevailing in some \nqua.rters an t~njust and injurious impression that they \nare m.t ~pensive house. On the cont.rary, they maint:Jain \ntha.t they readily keep a.breast of the cheapenina ten­\ndency of the times, a.nd tha,t thei1· ma .nufa.cture ~an be \nbought a,t prices suitable to every pocket. As a.n \nexample, they point out that they make both ladies and \ngentlemen's, umbr ellas as chea.p as 2s. 6d. each. They \na.Iso m~ke a. specia.lit;y of ladies fancy umbrellas at the· \nlow pnce of 4s. 6d., whilst t;heir Irish-made sunshades• \ncan be had from 2s. 6d. upwa .rds. A half-crown for \nwha .t a firm of repute affirms is a good reliable article \nseems to go down to the bed-rock of economy, and be­\ntween these low-priced ones and the deM·er kinds which \nrange to a.bout 30s. for sunshades a.nd 70s. for umbr ellas, \nthe purchaser of an Irish-made umbrella .. or pa.rasol is \nafforded a great variety of choice. 0 . \nLISTOWEL UNIO.N AND IRISH BLANKETS. \nIn an .advertis-ement of the Listowel Union inviting \ntenders f.o:r clo,t,hing, we read : - \"By Order of 1:ihe \nGuardi ans, a.I! .Al.-1:,icles of Clothing and Ma ,teria.ls sup­\nplied must be of Irish manufacture, and the name 9f \nthe Ma.nufa.cturiing Firm shall be stated.

It \nis not stU'prising that at a, subsequenti meet­\ning of the Listowel Board, tlhe question was brou~h~ up \nfor discussion. Mr. E. J.

CHANEL. \n_.,__.__._.: .. : ................ \nTHE CATHOLIC TRUTH SOCIETY OF IRELAND. \n' .... , - HERE is dissatisfaction in the country a.t the \nmanner in which the Catholic T'rutb Society is \nworked--or, perba.ps it would be more correcb to sa,y, not \nworked. The Society was st-a,rted about five yea.rs a.go. \nThe Irish Bishops not only gave it their a,pprobation, but \nit was advocated in many Pa.storals. B1·anches were es­\n·ta.blished in every diocese, and these not only in la.rge \ntowns but even in remote districts. Catholic Truth \nboxes were to be seen in almost every church; the publi­\n.ca.tions were largely bought up. In the coru·se of the in­\naugural address-in November, 1899--of the president, \nt-he present Arch bishop of Tua.m, his Gra.ce said : -\" The \nmain object of tfie Society is, as its na.me implies, the \n-diffusion, by means of cheap publications, of sound Cath­\nolic literature in popular form, so as to give insti:uctjon \na.nd edification in a mauner most likely to interest aml \nattract the general reader. It is well known that va.rious \nprinting presses in Great Britain da,ily pour out a. flood of \ninfidel and immoral publications, some of which over­\nflows to this country. vVe ha,ve a confident hope that \nthe Society's publications will remove the temptation _of \nhaving recourse to such filthy garbage, will create a taste \nfor a pure a.nd wholesome literature, and will a,lso serve \n.as an antidote against the poison of dangerous or im-\nmoral wi-itings.\" • \nNotwithstanding tha-t the publica.tions set out in the, \nfirst catalogue. were chiefly composed of reprints of 1his­\ntorical, devotiona,l and other works familia.r to -an older \ngeneration, they were new to many. The Society owed it~ \nimmediate origin to a paper read by the Rev. D1·. O 'Rio,r­\ndan, of Limerick, at the Maynooth Union of 1899, and \nit was at once successful beyond all expectations. But \nsocieties must march forward with the times; a constant \n.supply of new a.nd original works is necessary, and if \nthey are not procured it is only fair to ask the manage­\nment the reason why. As it is we hear tha,t the boxes \n·in many parishes have been closed. In a paper read by \nMr. R. ,J. Kelly, B.L., a.t the last Conference, he said:­\n\" Thus the boxes were in many places not kept up to \n-date-not filled with fresh supplies of book;;-and in too \nmany cases they were allowed to become the receptacle \nfor dog-eared, weather-beaten, dirt-covered books, tha.t \nonly repelled the public. And so, in too ma .ny instances \n·that came undeir my -own observ.ation even, have the \nboxes so kept become the means of inducing the public \n·to believe the Society was dead, or if not dead, in so \n·moribund a state that it; cn.nn.ot supply bool{S any \n'longer.'' It is all very well to blame_ the, brnx:ea. But is the \n•,state of some of these boxes a leadmg · cause of the state \n-of affairs of the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland 7 Does \nnot the gre·at respo•nsibility for the existing state of \n·things rest with the committee of management in no·t \nproviding the necessary variety of books to meet the \nwants of the reading public concer-ned 1 . There ~~-e \nplenty of writers, but perhaps they a!'e no~ m touch ~ti; \nthe committee. Surely it would not ho d1fficuJ.t L? br m_o \nabout a state of aJiairs ·that writers would submit then· \nworks to the Society just a-s articles ,a.re submit~d to an \neditor; and if there was a go-ahead mana.gement it ~ould \ninspire a go-a.head writing public. lt is, .a.,; we said, all \nvery well to blame the box:es, but what can the clergy ~r \nobhers do whose business it is to look after the boxes 1f \nthey .are unable, by action or inaction of the ma.nag-e­\nment, to get suita.bl.e supplies of books? The last annWLl \nwas a big volum.e cont,a,ining ma .ny photograp'hs, some ex­\ncellent; articles, and a large number of \nnames of t110se present. Sixpence in Ireland \nis .a rathe,r prohibitive price· for read~ng matte1:- 'l:1e \nfamous address by his Lordship the Bishop of L1meri~k \non University Education would have made a splenchd \npenny pamphlet ior.the Ca.tholic Truth boxes; as an item \nin the .annual at sixpence it was sentenced, as it :\"'ere, to \na very limited circula.tion; and we assume that sixpenny \npublications cam10t be placed in the boxes. The same \nremark a.pplies to the paper ''Protestantism and Pros­\nperity in Ireland,\" by itihe Rev. Dom . P . No-Ian, \nO.S.B., and R.ev. Dr. O 'R.iordan's• contribution to the \ndiscussion that followed it. These two papers w ere \nworthy of the very widest circula,tjon, but mixed up in a \nsixpenny volume with other articles of .less public in­\nterest, they were sent into the world with -a millstone \nrouna their necks. vVe have no brief for or a.gainst the \nSociety. vVe would like to see it vigorously doing the \nwork tiha,t it was started to do, but we fear iJhe,re is much \nroom for dissa.tisfaction at the way in which affairs are \ngoing 011. P erhaps, some of those who are de-eply in­\nterested in, a,nd informed about, the Society would let us \nha.ve their view s for publication. Vv e have published \nseveral contributed articles from time to time, a.nd at \nthe moment a few mild doses of a tonic in the shape of \npublic discussio,n would not do the public nor the \nMa:nagemenrt:. Committee any haJ·m. \n~•:••:• ............... \nTHEl ORANGE \"Ili'V'INOIBLES.\" \n0 \nN the 6th Ma;y, 1882, the Irisli Chief Secretary and \n1 \nthe Under-Secretary were stabbed to death in the \nPhrenix Parle The crime sent a thrill of horror through­\nou-t Ireland a.nd Grea,t Brita.in, and, indeed, throughout \nthe \" civilized wo'r!d,\" if one may use that expression \nwithout infringing copyright. The assassins were held \nup to execration, a.ud the whole cha.meter of the nation \nwas deemed disgraced by the dreadful deed. Despite the \nefforts of. the pa.rty• of Law and Order, however, it was \nfound, impossible to implicate the leader:s of the National \nMovement in the crime. The representa,tives of Law \na.nd Order, though 1-elying on forgers, perjurers, a.nd \nspies as their a!lies, and though trying their case before \na prejudiced British tribuua.l, failed to pi'<lve tha.t their \nopponents had expressed a post hoc sympa ,thy with the \nmurderers. Th~e wretched men received sympa,thy \nfrom no qua,rter; deserved none. Yet it should be \nborn~ in mind that what they did, they did for no per­\nson.a.I encl.

After the \nProcession incident tact was more than ever called 'for­\nbut, unhappily, tact has not been displayed. It will be \nremembered that at a rer.ent meeting in Dublin a charge \nof attempting to damn the collection was ma.de by one of \nthe speakers against ~• and-;-so far as the report in the \nFreeman showed-this cha,rge was permitted to be made, \nand the speaker was not rebuked or called to order by the \nChairman, who was one of the Vice-Presidents of the \nGaelic League; there certainly was not much tact shown \nthere. The Gaelic League has an official newspaper, bu{; \nthe newspaper remafoed silent. Before Se.(\\ c -c rl1 .(\\ 1 n \n1M 5,.,eu1~5e the Dublin Co1rue Ce,11111c,111, passed \nthe following resolution:-\" That in view of the manner \nin which the Post Office has endeavoured to obst,ruct ar­\nrangements for 'Seachtmhain na Gaedhilge,' a,nd the at-,, \nt~mpts from an unexpected quarter to injure. the collec­\ntion, we pledge ourselves to redouble our efforts to secure \nmost successful results.\" Now, it seems to us tha.t the \nout-rage on liberty committed by some apostles of \"free­\ndol!1 \" a.t the Procession, though not, of course, neces-­\nsanly traceable to these pronouncements was in con­\ntinui~y wit_h them. Tb~ incident subsequ~ntly came up­\nfor d1scuss1011 before Uus Dublin co1rue Ce.,,nnc-<.\\qt. \n,and the following, as a result, was sent to the Press: -\n''T'lte Committee then discussed the incident which oc­\ncurred .at the Languag e Demonstra.tion, about which D r. \n~Iac\".'7'a.lter, T .C., raised a. question at the Corporation \nmeetmg of the 13th inst., a.nd .after careful consideratiorl \nadopted the following:- \" While we regret that even in \none _isola-ted instance the hi:rmony of the La-nguage Pro-­\ncession should have been-d1sturbed, yet as the incident \nr~forrecl to was caused by persons acting without a.utho­\nnty, a.nd was due to the unauthorised introduction of au \nindividual into_ the sect-ion _reserved for '\\Jbe Oorporation, \nwe do not cons1der tha,t act1on on our part is caJJed for.\" \nAs we read this, it merely adds insult to injury. It is· \nonly jus~ ~ st-a.te tha.t the resolution was only adoptecl \nby a m a3onty. vV e hea,r there was a lengthened discus­\nsion over ib. We do not know how ma;ny of the ten memJ \nbers present belong to the Tin-Pike, or King, Lords and \nCommons faction of Irela.ncl, but that faction was repre­\nsented. The resolution is, indeed, a curious clocume11t. \nThe. regret expr-e,ssecl, such as it is, is o.n account of the \nha.rmon y of the Procession having been disturbed. N ow \nif the editor of this paper had quietly got out of Dr. \nM'~ Ta.lter's ca.rria.ge at the behest of the rouahs of \"free­\nrlom,\" a.nd if no public mention was made of°the footpad \ntact-ics, the harmony of the Procession would not ha.ve \nsuffered. Is .the rea.l regret of the majority of this me et­\ning of the Co•rue Ce-<.\\nnC.61(' at the outrage committed \nby the roughs. or at the consequent a.nnoya,ll(le and ,vant. \nof hannony brought about by the publicity which the \noutrage gained 1 The resolution of the majority of tihese \nten membe ,rs -0f the Coq•ue CP ... 1nnc,11p of Dublin sets \nout that .as the outrage was clue to the una.uthorised in­\ntroduction of a.n individual into the section reser,,ed for \nt;he Corporation \" they consider tha,t no action is called \nfor.\" As we rea.d this it is really mildly condoning the \nfootpad tactics. 'l'he objection of the roughs was not t.o \na.n individual out of place, but to an individual; there \nwould l1ave been no·objection to Mr. Gore, who also con­\ni:tituted in himself \"an unauthorised introduction of a.n • \nindividual into the section reserved for the Corpora,. \n·tion,\" for Mr. Gore is not a member of the Corpora,tion. \nSuppose one of the Councillors ha.d brough~ his wife with \nhim, and she was ordered out of t.be carnage as -a.n un­\na.uthorised individual by roughs, would the majority of \nthe fon members of the C01rue Ce 4\\1111C.6111 think that \n110 action was called fo1• 7 \nWe tm:n to the official orga,n of last week. There is no \napology, no expression of regret. T.be only reference to \nthe blackguardly conduct of these 1·oughs is as follows: -\n\"A correspondent 'W'ho does not give bis name has writ­\nten us to inquire wheth~r the Coisde Gn6tha, through \nAnG'laidheamhSoluis or otherwise, will offer any apology \nfor an incident· which occurred at the Dublin La.nguage \nDemonstration on Sunday week last. The same question \nhas been asked by one or two correspondents of the frish \nlndcpendr.11t. The answer, of course, is t\\1at the Proces­\nsion was ca,rried out under the auspices not 'of t-he Coisde \n/",

A wicked and sanguinary attempt has been made to thwart your will and thrust you back again into the house of Bondage with your capacity for self-government dis- credited before the world. ; The courage and devotion of our National Army has preserved you, but, although the armed conspiracy has been overcome, elements which seek to substitute the spirit of anarchy for the spirit of order remain, and any attempt te continue to carry on aets of brigandage and other acts of interference with the moral and ecenomic life of the country. Such attempt must be summarily and drastically dealt with until the person, the home, and the property of every EN respecting citizen is rendered absolutely secure.",

The \nfact, however, that Andrew Lysaght offers to send the admiral the arms \nof the O'Neylans in lieu of those of O'Huonyn, which could not at the \nmoment be procured, rather inclines me to think his mother must have \nbeen an O'Neylan.

About 1753 he was put in command of that part of the \nSpanish fleet stationed at Ferro!, twelve miles north of Corunna, a post \nwhich he held for two years until he relinquished it in November 1755 \nto an officer of higher rank. It may well have been that it was Admiral \nO'Huonyn himself who first sa~the merits of that splendid naval base \n;md secure harbour, up to that time a wretched fishing village, but which \nadvanced rapidly in importance, and is to-day a great arsenal and dock­\nyard with a population of about 24,000. \nNotwithstanding the old admiral's evident desire to end his days in \nIreland, he died it would appear in Spain, most likely in the City of \nCadiz. He was apparently an elderly man, more or less broken down in \nhealth, at the period covered by the correspondence, having served under \nthree kings of Spain, Philip V., Ferdinand VI., and Charles III. \n(2) This must be the same Christopher O'Brien who commanded If. M. S. Ripon \n(60 guns) at the sea fight off Cape Passaro, Sicily, (the ancient Pacltynum), Aug. \nII th, 1718, when the British under Sir George Byng, annihilated the Spanish fleet \nunder Castaneta. (The Royal Navy. A ~History, by Wm, Laird Clowes. Vol. iii., \np. 34.) If Daniel O'Huonyn was present at this action, he certainly met his old \npatron under very different circumstances to what existed when Capt. O'Brien gave \nhim his discharge just five years before. \nHaving made inquiries in every possible direction, I failed completely in identify­\ning this Christopher O'Brien. Two things are certain. A \"mere Irishman\" like \nhim would not be intrusted with the command of a British Man-of-war in 1718, unless \nhe was a member of one of the brancb.es of the name then in royal favour, and that he \nprofessed the Protestant religion. He could hardly be Christopher, younger brother \nof Morough, First Earl of Inchiquin, for he was seriously implicated in the Rebellion \nof 1641, and would be too old to command a battle-ship at the date mentioned; and \nhe certainly was not Christopher (son of Donaugh) of Ennistymon, who died an old \nman in 1743, for he was a \"papist,\" and got fined for having arms in his house in the \nreign of Queen Anne. vVho then was he?

One of the Hooliga.ns cha.rged us that we \n\"slandered the procession!\" And the 1-ingleader- the \ncoward who was afraid to give his na.me- wan1ed the \nedit.or that he (the editor) would be responsible for any \nconseque.nces if we o·bjected to be held up by these \nroughs. So ·that if we whipped on aga.ius't these, co-wa ,rds \nthey would hold us responsible if we hurt one -0£ them '. \nN ow, there were three ways of meeting these blackgua.rcls. \nOne was out of ,the question-and, no dou-b't the cowa.rds \nknew it--it was to caJl the minion& of the iaw- cre-t the • \n-police to scatter them. On e D.M .P. would have°clriven \ntenor int-0 the whole gang ; the second w.a,s to whip over \nthem. Tha,t, course, in view ?f the great crowds, might \n~-11.ve led to a crush _a.nd a, pa,n.ic amongst the people, and \n1f a, few of th~ pubhc were seriously hurt and killed as a \n,consequence, it would be very reo-rettable and the a.sser-\ntior1; of a member of the Coi:porition's right as a citizen \n~ga,1~st the cowardly interference of the roughs under \n;:,he circumsta,nces could sca1·cely be justified; it certa.inly \n• would not be prudent; a.nywa.y, people would natura.liy \nnot care to run such risks of injuring inn-ocent people \nmer_ely for the sake of asserting Irish citi1,ens' rights \naga-mst a gang of cowards ; the third course was •to cret, \nround .off the lane of procession, and join in later ~n. \nT~e third course was attempted, but the Hooligans were \nagile upon the feet, and a, more or less similar situation \nhad to be faced more tna.n -0noe. It was a matter of \nwhipping over the Hooligans or ca,Uing the police. After \nall, the wisest and most dignified coul'Se fo,r the member \nof t~e Corporation, ~hose: guests we , were, w.as to give up \nthe idea of proceeding with the procession in which he \nwa .s officia)ly invited by the Gaelic League to participate. \nR e accordmgly drove to one of his houses in the cit.y, a,nd \nso the matter ended; these Hoolig.a.ns in the Lan o·uaae \nProcession had gained their point. \n0 0 \nFor our part our chief regret was tlrn.t our foul ne­\nfarious selves, by being the guest of Dr. M '\\V' a.lter, \nbro~ght this annoyance upon him. T'he Hooligans \nwould have aJ1owed Dr . McWalter a.nd bis friend Mr. \nJ r;hn Gore, Solicitor, to pass throu\"h if the obno,xious \n-editor -0f t.:his paper, the third occupa-~t o.f .tJhe carriacre \nwould rid the carriage of ·hJs prese,noo at the behest° of \nthese roughs. Of cotu·se that was -out of tho question, \nand so Dr. McvValter attend-ing the processiion as ,1, \nmemb ei.r of t-l1e Oorpora:tion of Dubli-n was st.-o,ppcd on \nthe rouf;,e by roug:hs, one of whom wore the ba,dge of a \nSte~ard of the Language Procession.

It-deal,t with the fortunes not of a. man \nbut .,of .a, company , a.nd perluips at tihe present day we \nh:a.ve more need to consider the life~stories of directors \ntha,n ·of heroes. I have said the interest wa.si not, ·a \npe1-son,11l one, but t.he author so far consented to hearken \nto convention a6 to iiut;rweave a love-story and \nt-he Gaelic League hero, Dr. FitzGerald, had the task of \nconvert.iug .a-nd winning a c]l!\\,rming .heroine iu the per­\nson of Sheila Murpb.y , the manufacturer's daughter. \n'Dhe moral of the piece is tlrnt Irish industry should \ndepend on Irish c.1,pit,al, a-nd in .t.ruth we ihea,r a. greaL \ndeal too, about. a.t.t,ra.cting English investors w.ho'seldom \ncom e, and if t.l1ey eve-u do, come for no useful pu,rpose. \nJolu~ Murphy. :t local manufacturer of ·west-British \nideas, decides t.o turn his busi,ness -into a company to be \nfloated wit;h English c,ipita.1, a.nd caUs in, a Leeds Com­\npa:ny. prom ote.r to assist him . Th e result is ruin, from \n\\\\•hich -he is ouly s,wed by the t.imely intervention of \nDr. Fitzgei·a.!d a,nd a, loca,l commitLce wh o sa,ve the \nworks from being shut up , a.nd appoint. -l1im mana.ger. \nMr. \"Murphy's ·west British son, expert in na,ught save \nhockey, was well dra-wu , but I fear Mr. W. Fn1n was \ntoo good a-u Irishman to assume t;he haw-haw style with \n. perfocL success. Th ey should have hired or borrowe d a \nw·~t. Briton. The grea.t success of the ,play, a.nd wh a.t \nI thi1ik will recommend it to other societies, was the \nc1·editors' meeting. a scene worthy of the \"Bending \nof the Bough .'' l\\fr. T .

The attt'hor lost, no opportunity of preaching the \ndoctrinesor Irish· Ire!a.nd. It might, indeed, be sug­\ngested as a fair criticism on the play, as is often said in \nrega.i.'d 't-0 Dickens·s propagandist, novels, that it would \nbe-better if the reader or J.istcner were left to infer from · \nthe actio1J som e of the doc,trines enunciated by the \nchar.iders. Th e la-tter w ay is, however, ve:ry much the \ntendency of the French dra,matists. The play was \nvery well received, especially the scene I have refe.rred \nto, .and t,he-large hall was filled w.ith a crowded '.1-udience. \nI ,hope that the Cork NatiunaJ Theatre Soc1et,y may \nth·rive a nd produce ot,her original plays a.t succeeding \nShrove-tides. -CHANEL. \n................ : .. :.............,. \nBUNG'S .

The corresponding monument to the south has been destroyed by the fall of the wall since 1839; even in that year the heads of its arches were gone.

Commenced in 18 . . and completed in 1836.\" \nMrs. Knott ( 20) mentions the Bridge as in progress, but had to use the \nford in 1835. The ford of Beal an chip, of which we shall have more \nto say with regard to the O'Brien's battle in 1573 is supposed to have \nbeen near this spot. \nIn the field beside the bridge to the east of the river is the lofty \ntower of Dough (Doogh as pronounced), deriving its name from the \nsand hills (Dumhach) on which it stands. It is a gaunt tower five \nstorio's high, with a window facing N., S. and \\V. in each story, and no \ntrace of vaulting or staircase. The east wall has fallen en masse on to \nthe strand, a natural result to \"a house built upon the sand.\" The win­\ndows are rude, oblong opts, with flat arches and slab lintels, probably \nsuperseding older slit windows. The wall had fallen before 1839, and \na considerable mass, with (I think) a chimney, fell (I was told, in 1883) \nafter 1878 when I first saw, but unfortunately did not sketch the ruin. \nIt is much as when sketched in 1885. \nThe castle existed in 1422, when Rory, son of Conor O'Conor, \nLord of Corcomroe, was slain by his relative, the son of Felim O'Con­\nnor, \"in his own town of Caislean Dumhcha.\" ( 2 1) The Castle List \nsays that it was built by Donchadh, son of Domnall O'Conor (or \nDonagh Mac Conn), but gives no date. The castle seems to bave been \nowned by the O' Briens in 15 64, long before its formal transfer by the \nO'Conors in 1583. Sir Donall O'Brien held the castle of Duagh in \n(20) Two Months at Kilkee, p. 149. \n(21) Annals of Four Masters.",

O'Brien, of Dough, was one of \nthe few gentry that obtained a certificate of \"constant good affection,\" \nand saved much of his estates. He well deserved it for his confessed \nhumanity and liberality in 1642, doing all he could to save the lives and \n,entertain the harassed English settlers until they could find means of \nremoval to England, Captain George Norton, of Mooh or Moy Castle \nin Ibrickan, in 1642, besides witnessing these deeds, records Daniel's \nkindness and charity to several shipwrecked sailors.

It is a curious very late gothic screen, probably suggested by \nthe monument or sedile in the corresponding position in Kilfenora \nCathedral. It has a large quatrefoil ope overhead, and two cinque foil \narches below the top, covered by a bold hood forming a pointed arch, \nand with a mitred head on the keystone, curious, eared serpent heads of \nearly type decorate the ends of the hood, similar to those in Scattery \ncathedral; the sill and corner adjoining it are heaped deeply with skulls, \nbones, and coffin planks. \nThe corresponding monument to the south has been destroyed by \nthe fall of the wall since 1839; even in that year the heads of its arches \nwere gone. I have been able from its numerous fragments to give a \nrestoration, for there is only a diagram in the Ordnance Survey Letters. \nIt had two pointed arches, the shaft between them further branching up \ninto the covering pointed arch of the hood. The latter haJ a head ( z 5) \nwith a flat cap on the keystone, and ended in serpents of a different type \nfrom those opposite and holding short bars in their mouths. These two \nstructures are of very great interest from their late date and the curious \nsurvivals of early art. Though Irish Gothic Art is at present little \nesteemed outside this country, it would afford a most valuable subject if \na skilled architect undertook a monograph on its evolution, adaptations, \nand late survival. \nThe Monuments we omit for want of space, the oldest seems a very \ncurious inscription, which a correspondent sent to John Windele, and \nwhich O'Curry :partly unearthed in 1839, we utterly failed to find it, and \n(in the sketch) cannot decypher it any more than our predecessors. \nAnother has, in raised capitals, \"T. HEO. CLO\" (clerico) and dates \n1642. \nThe Saint's Well lies to the N.W. of the church. It has been long \nneglected, but at one time was believed to do good to sore eyes. St \nMacCreiche's Day was kept on Garland Sunday, (Domhnach chrom \n(25) Archdeacon Kenny mentions the tradition that mitud head represented St. \nMcCreehy and the flat-capped one represented St. Manaheen which, in face of the \nMacCreiche legend, is very probable.

The gentry who sold Ireland at the time of the Union, and who are now in process of selling her after another fashion, have good reason to esteem the privilege of having a country to _sell. Vhoever likes may see in Dunravenism a kind­ ling of the spark of patriotism in the hearts of these gentry or some of them i it is more natural to suspect them of trying to have their bread after having eaten it. Those members of the Land Conference, and those also of the public who would make sacrifices to coax the bought-out landlords to remain with us, were, and are, very forgiving. They were, and are, also very green. In their bloom, commanders of the garrison and all as they were during the last hundred years, these \"Irish\" gentry were simply ut ?f it, as nobilitr, over the water. shorn of then tails-although with the plu­ mage in their pockets-it is not likely they will be able to cut a dash in English society for the future.

We \nhave no sympathy with the-no doubt, well-intentioned \n--effort which is being made of late to \" spoon-feed \" \n.Irish industries, convinced, as we are, that a revival \n·movement, conducted upon the lines of paying a higher \nprice for an article merely because it is Irish, is abso­\n:Iutely impracticable as :well as unjust to the community \nat la,rge; a few manufacturers might, while the wave of \n,enthusiasm continued, reap a temporary benefit, but we \nbelieve that the ultimate result would be disastrous to \nIrish manufacture generally,, Speaking for ourselves, \nwe claim to compete fairly and squarely with the im­\n_ported article in the matter of quality, price, and \n\"G .ENUINE,, TRINIDAD OOOOA.BHELLS IC :&X­\nC.,'ELBIOB \" BRAND; tJut bnt; proour~ba; 17-, \n,M other. \n\"make-up\" of our paper.

Tins re­\nsult could not have been achieved by such artificial \nmeans as \"bolstering up .\" \nWe beg to say further that we are satisfied nothi.n-g \nbut injury could accrue to our own, and every other \nIrish industry, if such a foolish doctrine be disseminated \nas that which involves, in the case of Irish manufacture, \na pecuniary sacrifice upon the part of our customers. In \nconclusion, we wish to add that we are altogether op­\nposed to any measure being adopted which, while con­\nferring a transitory and questionable benefit upon a few \nIrish manufactlU'ers or m erchants, would undoubtedly \npress unduly upon the great mass of our people, includ­\ning the working classes, who se resources, to say the \nleast of it, are not unlimited. \nThanking you for yom· consistent and common sense \nsupport of home industries, we remain, yours faithfully, \nS.

The scope of th book is much wider than the title suggests.

There is no side of Irish peasant life that is not dealt with in this volume, and a1wys with a sympathetic pen.

That \nscene and tha_t sei'vicc was a purple patch on the dreary \ngrey_ ~f the hves of th?se who strive to keep alive the \ntrad1t1ons of the old faith and the old land in London. \nNow an opportunity arises, not only to mark Ireland's \nsense of appreciation for Archbishop Bourne's act, but, \nalso to create another memorable day for the London \nIrish. \nThe Royal Institute of Public Health holds its Annual \nCongress in Loudon this year, and the Mayors or other \ndelegates from every Sanitary Authority in Britain \nand Ireland are invited to attend, in· order to discuss \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \nW o are actu&l manufacturer■ of enr;r kind \nof Irish Art Jowellery, whioh wo produce {n \nour own workshops on the prcmh:ee. \nWo apeclaliao tho making of tho follo'll\"ing \nwell-known and beo.utiful brooohes :-\nTho T .. rn., Toro, Bn.Uinderey, Fibulae InnJ,. \nhow en, Kilkenny, etc., any of which' oau bt \nhad in either gold or silver. \nMed •nla and badges, our own original d.,_ \nsigns, mnnufnotorod at lowest pricea. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdlus, Sih,usmitbs, \nWatcb and Clockmak~rs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nOpposite O'Connell Monument, DU8l.lN. \nPRAYER BOOKS. \nMessrs.

Now, unless O is \nprivy to or approves of A's misconduct \nhe should immediately, on its coming to \nhis knowledge, repudiate and condemn it in the \nstronaest terms, otherwise the general public can only \ninfer that O insJigated A's action, or is highly delighted \nwith it, or else that C is in mortal dread of A.\" \nThe following let_ter from Dr . McWalter, T .G., ap• \npearecl in the Preeman' s J otff1ictl, of April 2oth: -·­\n\". Sir-At the meeting of the Dublin Corporation, when \n· it was announced that one of its members who had at­\ntended the Language Procession, on the special ,ip.vita­\ntion of its organisers, had been thrust out vi et a,rmis, \naud refused re-admission unless he consented to throw \nthe Editor of the LEADER to the-wolves, I requested that \nthere might be no discussion on the matter, as I had no \ndoubt that an ample apology and explanation would be \nforthcoming. Since that time the Keating Branch, \nwhich is by far the most active and useful branch of the \nOrganisation, as well as the Cleaver Branch have amply \nre~og11ised that such au apology was the only action pos­\nsible to any oody claiming the decencies of society. This \nwas uothiug le·ss thaq I expected; but I am amazed to \nfiud that a majority of the Central Executive of the \nGaelic League solemnly forbear t'o condemn an outraae \non one of their invited guests, committed by one of their \nown stewards, and punishable under the criminal law! \nSir, I have to say that the resolutiou adopted by the \nC~ntral E-xecutive acids a gross insult tp a deep injury. \nI Mtended in my official capacity as a member of the \nCorporation. lVIy· horses were seized after the fashion \nof highw aymen; :i; was thrust out of the Procession, and \n-the coachman was threatened with a.· score of weapons . \nI was warned that blood would be spilt if I attempted \nto move on, and the only excuse offered me for this \nmonstrous outrage is that I had given a seat to the \nEditor of the LEADER . I am aware that no personal \nobje?tion wa s held to rn~, but t.he persons present in my \ncarnage were my guests JUSt as 1f they were in my house. \nIf I happen ed to represent the -Corporation of Dublin in \nthe least civilised city in • the world, in Bucharest or \nBelgrade, in Constantinople or Cadiz, and if such an in­\ncident occurred, I should see that ample reparation was \ngiven in an hour's time. Nor can I believe that anyone \nin autho1_-ity would dare to suggest that they ought uot \nto apologise for the affront because they had not officially \nordered it. The position of the majority of the Exec11-\ntive of the Gaelic League, as I understand it, now is \nthat any steward may with impunity insult any repre­\nsentative ·person invited to the Processiou, may even \ncommit a criminal assault on him, and that they need \n?ot. even apo~ogise unless they have actually orde;.ed t,he \nrnc1dent ! Su·, I greatly fear that· the public will be \nslow to trust their mon eys to men whose views of re­\nsponsibility are so peculiar.-Yours truly, J . C . \nM'WALTER .\" • \nA letter in similar, though not ideutic:d, terms also \nappeared over Di:. l\\lI'\\,Valter's signature in the .lnclcpl'n­\nclent of the previous clay. \nIn the course of a note headed \" Insultin\"' a Jour­\nnalist,\" in last week 's issue of the Corl., S-11,11,~ our con­\ntemporary having quoted from DJ:.

It 1s safe to say that \nthe editor of the LEADER . has done a thousand times \nmore for the language cause than a single one of the \nignorant spalpini who assailed him and his host in the \nprocession.

As it is the majority of ,the Executive \nCommittee in so far as their action is .concerned have \nturned the Gaelic League into a sort of street brawlers' \nLeague . Of course, that is a situation that cannot \nstand. The League as a whole is all right, and \nthe vote of the majority of the Executive, though it has \nofficially rollea the League for the m oment in the gutter, \nwill have to be rescinded. If not, the Gaelic League in \nso far as the majority of_ the Executive at the last meet­\ning goes must remain before the public as a sort of \ncorner boys' League until the meeting of the -6.p-o-fe1r \nin August, when it will be the manifest duty of the dele­\ngates to elect a new Executive that may be trusted to pre­\nserve untarnished at all times•the honour and dignity of \nthe Organisation. \nThe Executive Committee has been selected up to this \nin an unsatisfactory and slip-shod fashion, and the Com­\nmittee thus selected has the power of co-opl;ion. Before \nthe next o.1m-t'e1rit s110uld be insisted upon that candi­\ndates for election should state their views and let the \ndelegates from all quarters of the country, and the Press \nhave some materials for forming a judgment on their \nclaims. The friends of street rowdies or those who, out \nof fear o(the noisy party that back up such blackguards, \nare afraid to denounce them, have no business 011 the \nExecutive Committee of an Organisation that makes for \nmanJiood and self-respect. \nWhat occurred at the E ,xecutive meeting 1 'Dhere \nwere men and women at that meeting who would recoil \nfrom trailing the Gaelic League in the gutter, as it has \nbeen trailed by the majority at that meeting. The Ii-ish \nIreland public are entitled to more info1·mation thtm \nthat a certain 1·esolution was passed. Was there tio \namendment 1 Who voted for attempting to affiliate· the \nwhole Gaelic League with street ruffians r Who ' voted \nfo1· common decency and for the dignity of the· Gaelic \nLeague--a movement, whatever misguided members of \nits Executive may say, that stands for self-reliance, man­\nhood and self-respect 1 The names of the proposer and \nseconder of the resolution that was passed have been \npublished by the official organ. That partial publica­\ntion has placed these two in an unenviable· l_ight before \nthe public. Have they been fairly dealt with 1 If their \nnames are published why not the names of those who \nvoted, and the amendments, if any, that were proposed 1 \nDo those who refuse to vote for decency and for keeping \nan honourable and great Organisation free from affilia­\ntion with street blackguardism wish to work from behind \nit hedge 1 Surely it is reasonable that those who have \nattempted to affiliate the Gaelic League to street black­\nguardism should be asked to do so in the light of day. \nWe ask for light and ventilation on this matter. As the \nnames of the proposer and seconder of the resolution that \nhas been passed-a resolution that has made the situa­\ntion worse than ever-have been published in the official \norgan, it is all the more reason that full publicity should \nbe given; and that an account of the amendments, if ,., \nany, and of the voting should be published. The olack­\nguards laid contribution on a policeman to remove Dr. \nMcWalter 's carriage from the Procession; we could, if \nwe choose, place at least one or two of these blackguards \nand whom we could identify, in the dock; but though \nthey sought the aid of a policeman we refrain from put­\nting the police upon them ; these are the fellows who \nopenly acted in the name of the League that a majority \n• of the Executive at the last meeting declined to con­\ndemn. We suggest that the public are entitled to a \nbrief account of what took place at the Executive \nmeeting and an account of the votes recorded. \nFather J. O'Dea, C .C., Loughrea, C o.

Since that time the Keating Branch, \nwhich is by far the most active and useful branch of the \nOrganisation, as well as the Cleaver Branch have amply \nre~og11ised that such au apology was the only action pos­\nsible to any oody claiming the decencies of society.

Nor can I believe that anyone \nin autho1_-ity would dare to suggest that they ought uot \nto apologise for the affront because they had not officially \nordered it. The position of the majority of the Exec11-\ntive of the Gaelic League, as I understand it, now is \nthat any steward may with impunity insult any repre­\nsentative ·person invited to the Processiou, may even \ncommit a criminal assault on him, and that they need \n?ot. even apo~ogise unless they have actually orde;.ed t,he \nrnc1dent !

As it is the majority of ,the Executive \nCommittee in so far as their action is .concerned have \nturned the Gaelic League into a sort of street brawlers' \nLeague . Of course, that is a situation that cannot \nstand. The League as a whole is all right, and \nthe vote of the majority of the Executive, though it has \nofficially rollea the League for the m oment in the gutter, \nwill have to be rescinded. If not, the Gaelic League in \nso far as the majority of_ the Executive at the last meet­\ning goes must remain before the public as a sort of \ncorner boys' League until the meeting of the -6.p-o-fe1r \nin August, when it will be the manifest duty of the dele­\ngates to elect a new Executive that may be trusted to pre­\nserve untarnished at all times•the honour and dignity of \nthe Organisation. \nThe Executive Committee has been selected up to this \nin an unsatisfactory and slip-shod fashion, and the Com­\nmittee thus selected has the power of co-opl;ion. Before \nthe next o.1m-t'e1rit s110uld be insisted upon that candi­\ndates for election should state their views and let the \ndelegates from all quarters of the country, and the Press \nhave some materials for forming a judgment on their \nclaims. The friends of street rowdies or those who, out \nof fear o(the noisy party that back up such blackguards, \nare afraid to denounce them, have no business 011 the \nExecutive Committee of an Organisation that makes for \nmanJiood and self-respect. \nWhat occurred at the E ,xecutive meeting 1 'Dhere \nwere men and women at that meeting who would recoil \nfrom trailing the Gaelic League in the gutter, as it has \nbeen trailed by the majority at that meeting. The Ii-ish \nIreland public are entitled to more info1·mation thtm \nthat a certain 1·esolution was passed. Was there tio \namendment 1 Who voted for attempting to affiliate· the \nwhole Gaelic League with street ruffians r Who ' voted \nfo1· common decency and for the dignity of the· Gaelic \nLeague--a movement, whatever misguided members of \nits Executive may say, that stands for self-reliance, man­\nhood and self-respect 1 The names of the proposer and \nseconder of the resolution that was passed have been \npublished by the official organ. That partial publica­\ntion has placed these two in an unenviable· l_ight before \nthe public. Have they been fairly dealt with 1 If their \nnames are published why not the names of those who \nvoted, and the amendments, if any, that were proposed 1 \nDo those who refuse to vote for decency and for keeping \nan honourable and great Organisation free from affilia­\ntion with street blackguardism wish to work from behind \nit hedge 1 Surely it is reasonable that those who have \nattempted to affiliate the Gaelic League to street black­\nguardism should be asked to do so in the light of day. \nWe ask for light and ventilation on this matter. As the \nnames of the proposer and seconder of the resolution that \nhas been passed-a resolution that has made the situa­\ntion worse than ever-have been published in the official \norgan, it is all the more reason that full publicity should \nbe given; and that an account of the amendments, if ,., \nany, and of the voting should be published. The olack­\nguards laid contribution on a policeman to remove Dr. \nMcWalter 's carriage from the Procession; we could, if \nwe choose, place at least one or two of these blackguards \nand whom we could identify, in the dock; but though \nthey sought the aid of a policeman we refrain from put­\nting the police upon them ; these are the fellows who \nopenly acted in the name of the League that a majority \n• of the Executive at the last meeting declined to con­\ndemn. We suggest that the public are entitled to a \nbrief account of what took place at the Executive \nmeeting and an account of the votes recorded. \nFather J. O'Dea, C .C., Loughrea, C o.

Last week our readers will recollect Messrs. S. \nIrwin and Son, Paper Manufacturers; the firm of Rath­\nborne elating back to 1488, Oandle Manufacturers; \nMessrs. M. Mahony Hros., Ltd., Blarney, Cloth Manu­\nfacturers; M \"ossrs. Ji~mes Watson and Co., Stained \nGlass Makers and Church Decorators of Youghal; Mr. \nJ. A. O'Connell, A.rt Marble Works, Cork; The Oity of \nGalway Woollen Manufacturing Co ., Ltd.; Galway, and \nthe Lee Boot Manufacturing Co., Cork, stated their \nviews, and one and all, of course, agreed with the views \nso frequently and forcibly set forth in the LEADER. \nThis· week we print the \".iews of the great Wexford \nAgricultural Implement and Bicycle Firm, Messrs . \nPhilip Pierce and Oo. ; of Messrs. W. Dennehy and \nSons, the enterprising and expanding Hat Manufactui·­\ning Firm; Messrs. P. J. Carroll arid Co., Tobacco \nManufacturers, of Dunclalk; Messrs. John McDonnel \nand Co ., Ltd., the Paper Makers of Saggart, Co . \nDublin; Messrs. E. Ryan and Co., Ltd., Soap Manu­\nfacturers, Cork; Messrs. ·James O'Mara and Son, Bacon \nFactory, Limerick, and Messrs. F . ·Smyth and Soil, \nUmbrella Manufactu 'rers, 75 Grafton Street, Dublin. \nOur readers will no doubt be struck by the sturdy \nand independent tone of all the letters. Messrs. Philip \nPierce and Co ., who have found a market for theii· \nmachinery and bicycles in face of the world's-competi­\ntion, ought to know what they are talking about; how­\never, we suppose the few sentimentalists who, with the \nbest intentions in the world, no doubt, have been doing \ngreat injury to Irish manufactui·e by their foolish. talk \nabout spoon-feeding Irish manufactmers at the expense \nof purchasers-we suppose these sentimentalists know \na great deal more about the matter than Philip Pierce \nand Co., of Wexford! • It -will be noticed that Messrs. \nvV. Dennehy and Sons, of Cork, expressly state \"Now, \nwe think, that Irish m anufacturers should protest \nagainst this view, which, in our experience, is doing a \ngreat deal of harm.\" Messrs. James O'lVfara and Son, \nof Limerick, remark that they sell 75 per cent. oJ \ntheir products in the English, Continental, and Colonial \nmarkets. That fact, as they point out, indicates a \nstate of apathy in the support of Irish goods in the \nhome market. It is obvious to any shrewd man that \nthis absurd sentimental cry of giving more for things \nbecause they are Irish, plays into the enemies' h!!,nds, \nand helps to defeat the purpose of a business-like 'indus­\ntrial revival by creating au impression that the supporj:, \nof frish goods is to be accompanied by a financial sacri­\nfice on the part of the pmchaser . It would be to the \ninterest of British manufacturers who are being hit m \nthe Irish market by the increasing support given to \nIrish goods that this absurd-a.ad thoughtless proposition \nshould be popularised. Next week we will publish ' . \nanother ba,tch of manufa._cturers' opinions. • \nMes~rs. Philip Pierce ,incl C'o., Agricultural Ma.chiner); \nand Cycle Manufacturers, of Wexford, write: -\n\" DEAR Sm,-In reply to the qu-z!'tions a.sked in your \nCircular-letter, of the 15th inst. We wish to have it \nclearly understood tlrnt as manufacturers, we do ·not \nwish it to go forth tlmt we in the slightest way desire \na grant in -our aid froJn our customers or the public. \nIt has always been our a.im :wcl object to meet foreign \ngoods fairly and squarely in the matter of price and \nquality. ',Ve put om· machinery in the market aucl sell \non merit solely, and we want no misunderstanding that \nas Irish manufacturers we wish to µnload our goods as \naaainst non-Irish goods of a similar-class on the strength \n. of a sentiment involving a pecuniary sacrifice by our \ncustomers. \n\" Om'. business is not a>t all .confined to.

MENZIES & Co., 90 West Nile Street, Glasgow. \nCURRENT I.FFI.IRB, \nAn influential correspondent, in the course of a letter \nto us, describes the situation which the recent resolution \nof a majority at last meeting of the Gaelic League Exe­\ncutive has created, in this way :-\"To me the position at \np1·esent seems to be this-A attacks B in the street, in \nthe interest--as he states there and then and subse­\nquently in the bidepende1it-of O (whose baclge he \nwears-'but this is not material). Now, unless O is \nprivy to or approves of A's misconduct \nhe should immediately, on its coming to \nhis knowledge, repudiate and condemn it in the \nstronaest terms, otherwise the general public can only \ninfer that O insJigated A's action, or is highly delighted \nwith it, or else that C is in mortal dread of A.\" \nThe following let_ter from Dr . McWalter, T .G., ap• \npearecl in the Preeman' s J otff1ictl, of April 2oth: -·­\n\". Sir-At the meeting of the Dublin Corporation, when \n· it was announced that one of its members who had at­\ntended the Language Procession, on the special ,ip.vita­\ntion of its organisers, had been thrust out vi et a,rmis, \naud refused re-admission unless he consented to throw \nthe Editor of the LEADER to the-wolves, I requested that \nthere might be no discussion on the matter, as I had no \ndoubt that an ample apology and explanation would be \nforthcoming. Since that time the Keating Branch, \nwhich is by far the most active and useful branch of the \nOrganisation, as well as the Cleaver Branch have amply \nre~og11ised that such au apology was the only action pos­\nsible to any oody claiming the decencies of society. This \nwas uothiug le·ss thaq I expected; but I am amazed to \nfiud that a majority of the Central Executive of the \nGaelic League solemnly forbear t'o condemn an outraae \non one of their invited guests, committed by one of their \nown stewards, and punishable under the criminal law! \nSir, I have to say that the resolutiou adopted by the \nC~ntral E-xecutive acids a gross insult tp a deep injury. \nI Mtended in my official capacity as a member of the \nCorporation. lVIy· horses were seized after the fashion \nof highw aymen; :i; was thrust out of the Procession, and \n-the coachman was threatened with a.· score of weapons . \nI was warned that blood would be spilt if I attempted \nto move on, and the only excuse offered me for this \nmonstrous outrage is that I had given a seat to the \nEditor of the LEADER . I am aware that no personal \nobje?tion wa s held to rn~, but t.he persons present in my \ncarnage were my guests JUSt as 1f they were in my house. \nIf I happen ed to represent the -Corporation of Dublin in \nthe least civilised city in • the world, in Bucharest or \nBelgrade, in Constantinople or Cadiz, and if such an in­\ncident occurred, I should see that ample reparation was \ngiven in an hour's time. Nor can I believe that anyone \nin autho1_-ity would dare to suggest that they ought uot \nto apologise for the affront because they had not officially \nordered it. The position of the majority of the Exec11-\ntive of the Gaelic League, as I understand it, now is \nthat any steward may with impunity insult any repre­\nsentative ·person invited to the Processiou, may even \ncommit a criminal assault on him, and that they need \n?ot. even apo~ogise unless they have actually orde;.ed t,he \nrnc1dent ! Su·, I greatly fear that· the public will be \nslow to trust their mon eys to men whose views of re­\nsponsibility are so peculiar.-Yours truly, J . C . \nM'WALTER .\" • \nA letter in similar, though not ideutic:d, terms also \nappeared over Di:. l\\lI'\\,Valter's signature in the .lnclcpl'n­\nclent of the previous clay. \nIn the course of a note headed \" Insultin\"' a Jour­\nnalist,\" in last week 's issue of the Corl., S-11,11,~ our con­\ntemporary having quoted from DJ:. Mc\\Valter's \nletter, acids:-\" Monstrous, abominable outraae it was \ndisgritceful to all responsible for it, and the E;ecutive \n?f .the Gaelic Le11igue :,1-re bla.mewortl_1y in refusing to \n111s1st ~n au apology bemg m~de. It 1s safe to say that \nthe editor of the LEADER . has done a thousand times \nmore for the language cause than a single one of the \nignorant spalpini who assailed him and his host in the \nprocession. It says little for the wisdom, tnct, or in­\ntelligence of t~e l~ca.cls of the organisation that they \nshould, by then· silence, allow such an outrage to go \nnnrebuked.\" \nOne day last _,veek the Anqual General Meeting of \nthe Cotinty Wexford Gaelic League was held.

Last week our readers will recollect Messrs. S. \nIrwin and Son, Paper Manufacturers; the firm of Rath­\nborne elating back to 1488, Oandle Manufacturers; \nMessrs. M. Mahony Hros., Ltd., Blarney, Cloth Manu­\nfacturers; M \"ossrs. Ji~mes Watson and Co., Stained \nGlass Makers and Church Decorators of Youghal; Mr. \nJ. A. O'Connell, A.rt Marble Works, Cork; The Oity of \nGalway Woollen Manufacturing Co ., Ltd.; Galway, and \nthe Lee Boot Manufacturing Co., Cork, stated their \nviews, and one and all, of course, agreed with the views \nso frequently and forcibly set forth in the LEADER. \nThis· week we print the \".iews of the great Wexford \nAgricultural Implement and Bicycle Firm, Messrs . \nPhilip Pierce and Oo. ; of Messrs. W. Dennehy and \nSons, the enterprising and expanding Hat Manufactui·­\ning Firm; Messrs. P. J. Carroll arid Co., Tobacco \nManufacturers, of Dunclalk; Messrs. John McDonnel \nand Co ., Ltd., the Paper Makers of Saggart, Co . \nDublin; Messrs. E. Ryan and Co., Ltd., Soap Manu­\nfacturers, Cork; Messrs. ·James O'Mara and Son, Bacon \nFactory, Limerick, and Messrs. F . ·Smyth and Soil, \nUmbrella Manufactu 'rers, 75 Grafton Street, Dublin. \nOur readers will no doubt be struck by the sturdy \nand independent tone of all the letters. Messrs. Philip \nPierce and Co ., who have found a market for theii· \nmachinery and bicycles in face of the world's-competi­\ntion, ought to know what they are talking about; how­\never, we suppose the few sentimentalists who, with the \nbest intentions in the world, no doubt, have been doing \ngreat injury to Irish manufactui·e by their foolish. talk \nabout spoon-feeding Irish manufactmers at the expense \nof purchasers-we suppose these sentimentalists know \na great deal more about the matter than Philip Pierce \nand Co., of Wexford! • It -will be noticed that Messrs. \nvV. Dennehy and Sons, of Cork, expressly state \"Now, \nwe think, that Irish m anufacturers should protest \nagainst this view, which, in our experience, is doing a \ngreat deal of harm.\" Messrs. James O'lVfara and Son, \nof Limerick, remark that they sell 75 per cent. oJ \ntheir products in the English, Continental, and Colonial \nmarkets. That fact, as they point out, indicates a \nstate of apathy in the support of Irish goods in the \nhome market. It is obvious to any shrewd man that \nthis absurd sentimental cry of giving more for things \nbecause they are Irish, plays into the enemies' h!!,nds, \nand helps to defeat the purpose of a business-like 'indus­\ntrial revival by creating au impression that the supporj:, \nof frish goods is to be accompanied by a financial sacri­\nfice on the part of the pmchaser . It would be to the \ninterest of British manufacturers who are being hit m \nthe Irish market by the increasing support given to \nIrish goods that this absurd-a.ad thoughtless proposition \nshould be popularised. Next week we will publish ' . \nanother ba,tch of manufa._cturers' opinions. • \nMes~rs. Philip Pierce ,incl C'o., Agricultural Ma.chiner); \nand Cycle Manufacturers, of Wexford, write: -\n\" DEAR Sm,-In reply to the qu-z!'tions a.sked in your \nCircular-letter, of the 15th inst.

MENZIES & Co., 90 West Nile Street, Glasgow. \nCURRENT I.FFI.IRB, \nAn influential correspondent, in the course of a letter \nto us, describes the situation which the recent resolution \nof a majority at last meeting of the Gaelic League Exe­\ncutive has created, in this way :-\"To me the position at \np1·esent seems to be this-A attacks B in the street, in \nthe interest--as he states there and then and subse­\nquently in the bidepende1it-of O (whose baclge he \nwears-'but this is not material). Now, unless O is \nprivy to or approves of A's misconduct \nhe should immediately, on its coming to \nhis knowledge, repudiate and condemn it in the \nstronaest terms, otherwise the general public can only \ninfer that O insJigated A's action, or is highly delighted \nwith it, or else that C is in mortal dread of A.\" \nThe following let_ter from Dr . McWalter, T .G., ap• \npearecl in the Preeman' s J otff1ictl, of April 2oth: -·­\n\". Sir-At the meeting of the Dublin Corporation, when \n· it was announced that one of its members who had at­\ntended the Language Procession, on the special ,ip.vita­\ntion of its organisers, had been thrust out vi et a,rmis, \naud refused re-admission unless he consented to throw \nthe Editor of the LEADER to the-wolves, I requested that \nthere might be no discussion on the matter, as I had no \ndoubt that an ample apology and explanation would be \nforthcoming. Since that time the Keating Branch, \nwhich is by far the most active and useful branch of the \nOrganisation, as well as the Cleaver Branch have amply \nre~og11ised that such au apology was the only action pos­\nsible to any oody claiming the decencies of society. This \nwas uothiug le·ss thaq I expected; but I am amazed to \nfiud that a majority of the Central Executive of the \nGaelic League solemnly forbear t'o condemn an outraae \non one of their invited guests, committed by one of their \nown stewards, and punishable under the criminal law! \nSir, I have to say that the resolutiou adopted by the \nC~ntral E-xecutive acids a gross insult tp a deep injury. \nI Mtended in my official capacity as a member of the \nCorporation. lVIy· horses were seized after the fashion \nof highw aymen; :i; was thrust out of the Procession, and \n-the coachman was threatened with a.· score of weapons . \nI was warned that blood would be spilt if I attempted \nto move on, and the only excuse offered me for this \nmonstrous outrage is that I had given a seat to the \nEditor of the LEADER . I am aware that no personal \nobje?tion wa s held to rn~, but t.he persons present in my \ncarnage were my guests JUSt as 1f they were in my house. \nIf I happen ed to represent the -Corporation of Dublin in \nthe least civilised city in • the world, in Bucharest or \nBelgrade, in Constantinople or Cadiz, and if such an in­\ncident occurred, I should see that ample reparation was \ngiven in an hour's time. Nor can I believe that anyone \nin autho1_-ity would dare to suggest that they ought uot \nto apologise for the affront because they had not officially \nordered it. The position of the majority of the Exec11-\ntive of the Gaelic League, as I understand it, now is \nthat any steward may with impunity insult any repre­\nsentative ·person invited to the Processiou, may even \ncommit a criminal assault on him, and that they need \n?ot. even apo~ogise unless they have actually orde;.ed t,he \nrnc1dent ! Su·, I greatly fear that· the public will be \nslow to trust their mon eys to men whose views of re­\nsponsibility are so peculiar.-Yours truly, J . C . \nM'WALTER .\" • \nA letter in similar, though not ideutic:d, terms also \nappeared over Di:. l\\lI'\\,Valter's signature in the .lnclcpl'n­\nclent of the previous clay. \nIn the course of a note headed \" Insultin\"' a Jour­\nnalist,\" in last week 's issue of the Corl., S-11,11,~ our con­\ntemporary having quoted from DJ:.

It 1s safe to say that \nthe editor of the LEADER . has done a thousand times \nmore for the language cause than a single one of the \nignorant spalpini who assailed him and his host in the \nprocession. It says little for the wisdom, tnct, or in­\ntelligence of t~e l~ca.cls of the organisation that they \nshould, by then· silence, allow such an outrage to go \nnnrebuked.\" \nOne day last _,veek the Anqual General Meeting of \nthe Cotinty Wexford Gaelic League was held.

Raw students from the Royal University and young Freshmen from Trinity are check by jo.wl with hardened pressmen or ambitious civil servants, or Dutchmen from South Airica-Oecil Rhodes' scholars doing the tour of the world. The mark of the LEADER influence is seen at the grace. No man living has been found who knows the words of the grace. It is evidently in Latin, and its composition is attributed to Erasmus. the first word, \" Benedicas \" wafts solemnity over the standing assembly, but the remainder has been for years a mystery. Now about the half or nearly half, are Catholics. Opposite sides are not so evenly balanced at any other function. But some years ago the Oatholic's tribute to his Faith was a furtive shamefaced sweep of his hand over the region of the abdomen when grace was said ; and some of the baser sort did not even do so much . But now so much more backbone has been in­ fused into the younger students that they invariably bless themselves in a way that is careful, open, deTi­ berate, and even almost ostentatious. The \" Dark Brothers \" who used to think it the height of wisdom not to pretend that they were Papists, are now shamed into some sort of a sign of Catholicity-but largely for fear that they should be despised by the Protestants present who generally like the man who presents his colours.

Rotunda on Saturday, \nwe sho_uld be compelled to admit that the influence of \nthe League is dimini~hiug instead qf increasing in and \naround the metropol~s. It ~as a very poor Feis, no \nmatter from what pomt of view we regard it. In the \nfirst place, the attendance of the general public was \n• very small, and this remark applies equally to the day \nproceedings and to the .Cuirm Ceoil in the evening. \nApart from the competitors and officials there were \nscarcely a hundred people present at the competitions, \nand I have never seen a smaller gathering at a Ouirm \nCeoil in the Round Room, except, perhaps, the audience \nthat used to attend the performances of the Oireachtas \nChoir. This is unsatisfactory, for it cannot fail to leave \nthe committee with a considerable balance to the wrong \nside when the accounts of the Feis are closed.\" \nHappily for himself these notes are written by \"An Lcv­\nrecha:1rn,\" and we all know that a Levrechawn is not the \neasiest thing in the world to catch. In the days of our \nextrelI!e youth we made many a fruitless search in the \nearly hours of the morning for a Levrecha,11,n. The \nstreet blackguards of the Gaelic League who remain \nundenounced by the E -xecutive will have their work cut \nout for them if they wish to \" hold up \" a Leprecha.itn \nfor his critical note. Catch your Lcvrecliaim before \nyou h~ld him up. \n'\\Ve received-no invitation to the P e1·s, and so cannot \n-speak of it from personal observation. In view of the \nnotes we have quoted from the lndevenclent and from \nthe Weekly Freeman, it is perhaps only fair to g_ive t~e \nfollowing from the official organ : -\" The D~bhn F~is \nproves amongst other t~ings that the ~eague m Dubhn \nis very much alive,-ahve not _merely m the se~1se that \nit ca-n astonish the public by a huge demonstration once \na year, but in the sense tha~ it is working all the \nwhile, that it is actually producmg spea~ers_ and readers \nand writers of the language.\" As the JUmor reporters \nsay, comment is· needless. The organ that tapped t~e \ncriminal street blackguards on the. back and t~at is \nlikewise a \"confrere \" of the official organ, said: -\n\" No one who attended the Dublin Feis last Sat~tr?ay \ncould fail to be struck with the improvement exh~bited \n• in practically all the competitions.'' An~ agam : -\n\" The concert at night was one of th~ best Insh concerts \nrecently given in Dublin. The audience was large, ~ut \nit should have been even larger.\" Our re'.1-ders, with­\nout any suggestion from us, can make then· own com­\nments. The fight before the League three _months ago \nwas enough to try the strongest !1eart ; smce ~he~ a \nweak Executive has in a sense alhed the Orga~usat~on \nwith street blackguardism, and the consequ~ut situation \nis anything but encouraging.

Again, while they are being taught, the philan­\nthropists supplying the money regardless of result, the \nproduce is placed on the market, through private in­\nfluence, much to the detriment of the legitimate and, in \nmany cases, struggling manufacturer and trader. \n\"vVe would like to know how m any of these so-called \ncharity firms or associations have been started in Ireland \nduring the last few years, some even und er royal patron­\nage, and after surviving for a short time, cutting down \nprices, as profit was not their object, by temporary re­\nlief remain in existence now, after, perhaps, in Na .ny \ncases, doing a little good for the time being in their \nown immediate .locality; but, in reality, leaving the \nmatter worse than they got it, having compelled the \nheavily-taxed manufacturer to reduce his prices. \nTrusting you will succeed in your honest and sensible \nexertions to revive and keep in the front Irish-manufac­\ntured goods, as all we as Irish manufacturers wan£, is \na fair field and no favour, and every Irish man, woman, \nand child to help us by buying our 'goods.-W .. e are, \nyours faithfully, H .

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling.

And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter.

The mark of the LEADER influence \nis seen at the grace. No man living has been found \nwho knows the words of the grace. It is evidently in \nLatin, and its composition is attributed to Erasmus. \nthe first word, \" Benedicas \" wafts solemnity over the \nstanding assembly, but the remainder has been for years \na mystery. Now about the half or nearly half, are \nCatholics. Opposite sides are not so evenly balanced at \nany other function. But some years ago the Oatholic's \ntribute to his Faith was a furtive shamefaced sweep of \nhis hand over the region of the abdomen when grace \nwas said ; and some of the baser sort did not even do \nso much . But now so much more backbone has been in­\nfused into the younger students that they invariably \nbless themselves in a way that is careful, open, deTi­\nberate, and even almost ostentatious. The \" Dark \nBrothers \" who used to think it the height of wisdom \nnot to pretend that they were Papists, are now shamed \ninto some sort of a sign of Catholicity-but largely for \nfear that they should be despised by the Protestants \npresent who generally like the man who presents his \ncolours. \nThe conduct of some of the Gatholic judges occa­\nsionally gives rise to adverse comment. They are the \nDi:i M ajores of those functions, and should be models \nto the Catholic students. Some of them omit to cross \n-themselves at the grace, whether from a furtive hope \nthat their Catholicity will be forgotten or a despicable \ndread of irritating their neighbours. Much may be \n-forgiven a man when he is clutching for power and \nplace, but once he has attained office he has nothing \nfurther to gain by acting the recreant. In the rules \n,vhich CtU'ran gave to his \" Monks of the Screw,\" they. \nwere to be chaste-till they were tempted, and never \nto tell a lie-except when the truth was not convenient. \nIn a like spirit of homely wisdom their lordships might· \nconsider that they ought to be good Catholics~when \nnothing is to be gained by being otherwise. \nInoLATOR. \n................ : .. : ................ \nTHE MANUFACTURERS AND THE INDUSTRIAL \nREVIVAL. \nMessrs.

M'Namara--these various \nclasses of men were amongst those present, and their \nnames indicate the broad and representative basis upon \nwhich the proposed exhibition in July of next year is \nto be carried out. \nMr. T. A. Ferguson proposed \"that an Industrial \nExhibition be held in Limerick, opening the first week \nin July, 1906, to be called 'The Munster and Connacht \nIndustrial Exhibition.\" In supporting this resolution \nMr. James S. Gaffney, Solr., in the course of his re­\nmarks as reported in the ~/Jfunster 1Yews, said:-\" It was \na great pity that they, Limerick people, and Irish \npeople as a whole, especially in the South of Ireland, \nshould not rely sufficiently on themselves, and show that \nreliance by buying where they could goods made in Ire­\nland that were as good and cheap as goods made else­\nwhere (hear, hear).

If they put that forward \nin supporting this Exhibition, it would be a success.\" \nA Committee consisting of the E ,xecutive of the Lime­\nrick Industrial Association and the following-with \npower to adcl to their numbers--were appointed to carry \nout the arrangements for the. Munster and Connacht \nExhibition of 1906 :-Sir Thomas Cleave, Messrs. J. E. \nGoodbody, Archibald Murray, James Quin, Samu 'el Lee, \nWilliam Lloyd, David Tidmarsh, John Egan, A. Bar­\nnett, W. L.

Bourke together with the \nManagers of the five Banks in the city. \nThere was a \" Grand Christy Minstrel \" entertain­\nment and· concert at St. lVfary's Temperance Hall, Irish­\ntown, Glomnel. A programme of the great event is \nbefore us. The strenuous, manly and self-respecting \nmajority at a recent meeting of the Executive of the \nGaelic League in Dublin should look after the Olonmel \nniggers. 1'hey had no Irish vocal items, nay,, even \nmore, they had no Anglo-Irish vocal item at their enter­\ntainment at St. Mary's Temperance Hall, Irishtown, \nOlonmel, and yet no \"unauthorised persons\" even \n·\" held up\" Bones I • One of the niggers sang \"Looking \nfor a Coon like me.\" vVho was looking for him 7 As \nwe are persons \" obnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" perhaps \nwe have no right to intrude our enquiries into such mat­\nters.

There are possibly \" unauthorised \" Coons \nas well as \" unauthorised\" Gaelic L~aguers I And if the \nGaelic League authorities are above criticism, why \nshould not the Coons, also, be exempt 7 Very Rev. \nCanon Flavin, P .P., au Irish speaker, is Director of the \nT em perance Sodality, but Canon Flavin is not respon­\nsible for this un-Irisb programme. We are informed \nthat Canon Flavin, with his own money acquired two \nhouses (one of them a drunkery, the licence of which he \nextinguished). These two houses he reconstructed, ex­\ntended, furnished, fitted and converted into a Tem ­\nperance Hall for the benefit of his parishioners. The \nworking tnen themselves were given a free band in mak­\ning out the programme of their first concert, and the· \ninnane and unnational thing that we have been refer­\ning to was the result. More than one member of the \nCommittee attempted to hav.e national songs introduced, \nbut to no purpose. The performers, all, we understand, \n\"patriots \" of the greenest type, were more concerned \nabout showing off their powers as vocalists in nigger and \nEnglish lyrics than singing even Anglo-Irish songs like \n\"The Wearing o' the Green,\" \"Who fears to speak of \n'98,\" or even Moore's melodies. But as persons \"ob­\nnoxious to Irish Ireland,\" what business is it of ours? \nSome members of the Executive of the Gaelic League \nshould look aHer these niggers of Clonmel. \nWe have received a report of the annual meeting of \nthe Duhallow C'oisde C'eanntair which was held recently \na,t Boherbee. Father P'. O'Regan, C.O., Vice-President, \nwas in the chair. The Secretary's report was as \nfollows :-The C'oiscle was established at a meeting held \nin Kanturk, on March 25th, 190-4, and bas been, there­\nfore, something more than twelve months in existence. \nDuring that time eight meetings have been held and \ntwenty-five resolutions passed, and this represents the \nsum total of the work .of your body. When the Coi~de \nwas established all the six branches of which it consists \nwere conducting Irish classes; but owing to the want of \na competent teacher among their members, no classes \nwere conducted in two of these branches during last \nsession. It will, therefore, be seen that the language \nis in a worse condition in Duhallow at present than it \nwas twelve months ago. vVere it not for the a.ction, or \nrather inaction, of your Coiscle and of the Coiscle \nGnotlw, these two branches would probably have \nmanaged to have classes somehow. As early \nas M'ay last, the question of appointing a \ntravelling teacher for the Coisde C'ecmntair area was \nunder consideration, but was postponed to \nOctober. vVlien the matter was brought on again at \ntlie October meeting, the majority of the delegates re­\nfused to take any action-on it, and would not even ask \nthe C'oiscle Gnotlui for a subsidy towards paying a teacher \nfor the branches that had none. The Secretary of one \nof the branches affected, seeing that no help was to be \nexpected from yom body, explained to the Goisde Gnotha \nthat his branch would fall through unless they got \nsome aid from the Central body to help them to pay \nthe salary of a teacher.

When the Coi~de \nwas established all the six branches of which it consists \nwere conducting Irish classes; but owing to the want of \na competent teacher among their members, no classes \nwere conducted in two of these branches during last \nsession. It will, therefore, be seen that the language \nis in a worse condition in Duhallow at present than it \nwas twelve months ago. vVere it not for the a.ction, or \nrather inaction, of your Coiscle and of the Coiscle \nGnotlw, these two branches would probably have \nmanaged to have classes somehow. As early \nas M'ay last, the question of appointing a \ntravelling teacher for the Coisde C'ecmntair area was \nunder consideration, but was postponed to \nOctober. vVlien the matter was brought on again at \ntlie October meeting, the majority of the delegates re­\nfused to take any action-on it, and would not even ask \nthe C'oiscle Gnotlui for a subsidy towards paying a teacher \nfor the branches that had none. The Secretary of one \nof the branches affected, seeing that no help was to be \nexpected from yom body, explained to the Goisde Gnotha \nthat his branch would fall through unless they got \nsome aid from the Central body to help them to pay \nthe salary of a teacher.

If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G.

In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know .

Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses.

But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V.

And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter.

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

The circular 1s signed by Su· Wilham Gould­\ning, Baronet, on behalf of the Direc~ors, a~d w~ ~ssu~e \nthait Sir William is the author of 1t. Sn· Wilham is \nannoyed. If the shareholders of the ill-fated National \nAssurance Company had, a few years ag_o, taken ac­\ntion and asked for a Committee of Inquiry, we have \nno .doubt that Joseph Todhunter Pim would have bee~ \nahnoyed; and Joseph Todhunter Pim, tho~gh ~o~ a \nBaronet, is as highly respectable a man as Su· Wilham \nGoulding . We are not surprised that Sir Willia!° \nGoulding and the directors, including F1:ederick C . Pil­\nkington, J.P., D.L., who is also a director of the Na­\ntional .Assurance Oo., are annoyed . It is only hum~n \nnature. If the mistress of the house pays a surprise \nvisit of inquiry to the nursery, it is human enough that \nthe nursery maid should feel annoyed, and it is human \nthat the directors of the G. S. and W . Railway should \nfeel annoyed when common, low-down shareholders of the \nCompany display an inquiring turn of mind. In the \noue case, however, the mistresses' first concern is the \nhealth and welfare of the children; in the' other the \nshareholders' concern is the health and welfare of their \nproperty. The petulance of nursery maids and railway· \ndirectors must be taken as part of the day's work. \nWe take it from Sir William's petulant letter that \nthe directors-nine of whom, by the way, have not, in \nthe aggregate, as large a stake in the Company as one \nparticular member of the Shareholders' Committee - we \ntake it that the directors intend to stave off the inquiry; \nThey would be wiser, we suggest, if they courted inquiry; \nbut they know their own know . If ~heY: do not w~nt \nan inquiry, they have reasons for then· d1s~aste for it; \nand the ordinary shrewd shareholder, puttlllg two a~d \ntwo toaetber, will not feel any the more confidence lll \nthe co1~cern and its manag em ent in consequence of the \nanti-inquiry disposition shown by the Bo ar~ of Direc­\ntors. Of course, no one makes any reflection on . the \npersonal integrity of the hi~hly respecta~le ~entlemen \nwho compose the Bo ard of Dn·ectors; but lll view of the \nawful collapse of the N ational Assurance Company it \nis not business to expect shareholders to place infallible \ntrust in the ability of. any collection • of men however \nhigh their respectability may be-particularly in view. \nof the serious depreciation of the property. \nSir William Goulding and his co-directors were so \nhard pressed for a reply to the statement made on be­\nhalf of the Shareholders' Committee that in their des-\n. peration they tried to drag religious denominationalism \n.into the mat ter! Why this dragging of matters con­\nnected with religious persuasion into business~ This \nis purely a bitsincss ma tter; and the attempt of the \ndirectors to draw a denominational red herring across \nthe trail only shows the desperation to which they have \nbeen driven. Sir William Goulding refers·to the fall in \ncertain other railway company shares. Well , probably \nthese railways would be none the worse if Shareholders' \nCommitte es of Inquiry looked into then: affairs. Oi \ncourse, the shareholders of the -Great Southern and \nWestern Railway ought to feel very thankful that it \nwas in that railway, and not in the National Assurance \nCompany, that they had their money; there was a good \ndeal, no doubt, in the remark of the man who, on see­\ning his new hat· being rolled over by a train, remarked:­\n\"Well, I ought to be very thankful that my head was \nnot in it.\" The shareholders of the Great S . and W \nRailway could be in a ~vorse plight; the National As­\nsurance shareholders have not only lost all their money, \nhut they are to be mulcted in a big \"call\" to meet \nthe losses. The shar~s of other railways have shown a \ndrop in value as well a_s the Great S. and W.; these \nthings are c;onsoling. But the situation is_.:...the pro­\nperty of the ordinary shareholders has so considerably \ndepreciated in value-nearly to the extent of three mil­\nlions sterling in a few years-that every consideration \nof prudence and business loudly calls for a Committee of \nInquiry into the affairs of the Company. To what­\never extent those causes that have depreciated the capi­\ntal value of Consols may have operated in depreciatina \nthe capital value of the Ordinary Stock of the G.S. and \n'\\V. Railway, it is clear that those causes have not had \nand could not have had, any influence whatever on th~ \nearning powers of the shareholders' property. And \nthe profits have seriously gone down. \nSir-William Goulding and the directors have brouaht \nheat, and attempted to drag partisanship, and even :ec­\ntariau prejudice, into this purely business matter. Act­\ning thus, they showed their weakness and their chagrin.",

Walker Jackson, who figures as President in January \n1785, ,vas a well known gentleman in his day. John O'Keeffe, in his \nRecollections (vol. i, p. 183), tells us that \"he was a fine gentleman, of \ngreat landed property, and a complete n1usician on the pipes ; they \nnamed him Piper Jackson.\" \nThe following are the best known of his musical compositions, and \nare re1narkable for their harmony and expression :-Jackson's l\\forning \nBrush, The Turret, 1'he.Humours of Castle Jackson, Jackson's Ramble, \nRoving Blade, and the Cream of the Jest (Ferrar, Hist. Limk., p. 174 \n' 1787 Ed .). O'Keeffe mentions another brother who figured among the \n' \n\"bucks\" about town. \"'fhe fan1ous Irish bucks of those days were \nSt. Leger, lvlassy, Richard Dawson, Beaucha1np Bagnell, and Hero \nJackson-the latter a fine figure of the Hercu les kind, but niore elegant; \nhis real Christian name was Miles, but he ,vas called the hero, fro111 \nhaving conquered every competitor in exploits of agility and athletic \nexercises.\" He was Sheriff of the City in 1773.",

Since that time the Keating Branch, \nwhich is by far the most active and useful branch of the \nOrganisation, as well as the Cleaver Branch have amply \nre~og11ised that such au apology was the only action pos­\nsible to any oody claiming the decencies of society. This \nwas uothiug le·ss thaq I expected; but I am amazed to \nfiud that a majority of the Central Executive of the \nGaelic League solemnly forbear t'o condemn an outraae \non one of their invited guests, committed by one of their \nown stewards, and punishable under the criminal law! \nSir, I have to say that the resolutiou adopted by the \nC~ntral E-xecutive acids a gross insult tp a deep injury. \nI Mtended in my official capacity as a member of the \nCorporation. lVIy· horses were seized after the fashion \nof highw aymen; :i; was thrust out of the Procession, and \n-the coachman was threatened with a.· score of weapons . \nI was warned that blood would be spilt if I attempted \nto move on, and the only excuse offered me for this \nmonstrous outrage is that I had given a seat to the \nEditor of the LEADER . I am aware that no personal \nobje?tion wa s held to rn~, but t.he persons present in my \ncarnage were my guests JUSt as 1f they were in my house. \nIf I happen ed to represent the -Corporation of Dublin in \nthe least civilised city in • the world, in Bucharest or \nBelgrade, in Constantinople or Cadiz, and if such an in­\ncident occurred, I should see that ample reparation was \ngiven in an hour's time. Nor can I believe that anyone \nin autho1_-ity would dare to suggest that they ought uot \nto apologise for the affront because they had not officially \nordered it. The position of the majority of the Exec11-\ntive of the Gaelic League, as I understand it, now is \nthat any steward may with impunity insult any repre­\nsentative ·person invited to the Processiou, may even \ncommit a criminal assault on him, and that they need \n?ot. even apo~ogise unless they have actually orde;.ed t,he \nrnc1dent !

Surely Wexford, having \nin defiance of the advice of the Executive denounced the \nstreet blackguards---surely vVexford is now a qualified \n\"rotten limb\" and should be amputated at once! \nThe following appeared in the official organ of the \nGaelic League, that it will be remembered neither ans­\nwered our recent questions nor our criticisms : -\" This \ndecision (the resolution of the Dublin Coisde \nCeanntair) had been a.ppealed against by one or \ntwo Craobhacha, and others had written to the Cciisde \nprotesting against the appeal and urging the Coisde \nGnbtha to endorse the resolution of the Coisde Ceanu ­\ntair.\" \\Ve turn up om· back numbers and we find that \nthe following branches took action concerning the crimi­\nnal street blackguarclism committed in the name of the \nLeague that a majority of the Executive Committee has \nrefused to denounce : -Cavan Branch, the Keating \nBranch , the Newcastle West Co1ru e Ce ,,n11c,,1p Lime­\nrick Gaelic League , Clonmel Branch, Cleaver Branch, \nDublin; Father Sherlock Branch, Birmincrham.

As it is the majority of ,the Executive \nCommittee in so far as their action is .concerned have \nturned the Gaelic League into a sort of street brawlers' \nLeague . Of course, that is a situation that cannot \nstand. The League as a whole is all right, and \nthe vote of the majority of the Executive, though it has \nofficially rollea the League for the m oment in the gutter, \nwill have to be rescinded. If not, the Gaelic League in \nso far as the majority of_ the Executive at the last meet­\ning goes must remain before the public as a sort of \ncorner boys' League until the meeting of the -6.p-o-fe1r \nin August, when it will be the manifest duty of the dele­\ngates to elect a new Executive that may be trusted to pre­\nserve untarnished at all times•the honour and dignity of \nthe Organisation. \nThe Executive Committee has been selected up to this \nin an unsatisfactory and slip-shod fashion, and the Com­\nmittee thus selected has the power of co-opl;ion.

Was there tio \namendment 1 Who voted for attempting to affiliate· the \nwhole Gaelic League with street ruffians r Who ' voted \nfo1· common decency and for the dignity of the· Gaelic \nLeague--a movement, whatever misguided members of \nits Executive may say, that stands for self-reliance, man­\nhood and self-respect 1 The names of the proposer and \nseconder of the resolution that was passed have been \npublished by the official organ. That partial publica­\ntion has placed these two in an unenviable· l_ight before \nthe public. Have they been fairly dealt with 1 If their \nnames are published why not the names of those who \nvoted, and the amendments, if any, that were proposed 1 \nDo those who refuse to vote for decency and for keeping \nan honourable and great Organisation free from affilia­\ntion with street blackguardism wish to work from behind \nit hedge 1 Surely it is reasonable that those who have \nattempted to affiliate the Gaelic League to street black­\nguardism should be asked to do so in the light of day. \nWe ask for light and ventilation on this matter. As the \nnames of the proposer and seconder of the resolution that \nhas been passed-a resolution that has made the situa­\ntion worse than ever-have been published in the official \norgan, it is all the more reason that full publicity should \nbe given; and that an account of the amendments, if ,., \nany, and of the voting should be published. The olack­\nguards laid contribution on a policeman to remove Dr. \nMcWalter 's carriage from the Procession; we could, if \nwe choose, place at least one or two of these blackguards \nand whom we could identify, in the dock; but though \nthey sought the aid of a policeman we refrain from put­\nting the police upon them ; these are the fellows who \nopenly acted in the name of the League that a majority \n• of the Executive at the last meeting declined to con­\ndemn. We suggest that the public are entitled to a \nbrief account of what took place at the Executive \nmeeting and an account of the votes recorded. \nFather J. O'Dea, C .C., Loughrea, C o.

Since that time the Keating Branch, \nwhich is by far the most active and useful branch of the \nOrganisation, as well as the Cleaver Branch have amply \nre~og11ised that such au apology was the only action pos­\nsible to any oody claiming the decencies of society. This \nwas uothiug le·ss thaq I expected; but I am amazed to \nfiud that a majority of the Central Executive of the \nGaelic League solemnly forbear t'o condemn an outraae \non one of their invited guests, committed by one of their \nown stewards, and punishable under the criminal law! \nSir, I have to say that the resolutiou adopted by the \nC~ntral E-xecutive acids a gross insult tp a deep injury. \nI Mtended in my official capacity as a member of the \nCorporation. lVIy· horses were seized after the fashion \nof highw aymen; :i; was thrust out of the Procession, and \n-the coachman was threatened with a.· score of weapons . \nI was warned that blood would be spilt if I attempted \nto move on, and the only excuse offered me for this \nmonstrous outrage is that I had given a seat to the \nEditor of the LEADER . I am aware that no personal \nobje?tion wa s held to rn~, but t.he persons present in my \ncarnage were my guests JUSt as 1f they were in my house. \nIf I happen ed to represent the -Corporation of Dublin in \nthe least civilised city in • the world, in Bucharest or \nBelgrade, in Constantinople or Cadiz, and if such an in­\ncident occurred, I should see that ample reparation was \ngiven in an hour's time. Nor can I believe that anyone \nin autho1_-ity would dare to suggest that they ought uot \nto apologise for the affront because they had not officially \nordered it. The position of the majority of the Exec11-\ntive of the Gaelic League, as I understand it, now is \nthat any steward may with impunity insult any repre­\nsentative ·person invited to the Processiou, may even \ncommit a criminal assault on him, and that they need \n?ot. even apo~ogise unless they have actually orde;.ed t,he \nrnc1dent !

The Ii-ish \nIreland public are entitled to more info1·mation thtm \nthat a certain 1·esolution was passed.

That partial publica­\ntion has placed these two in an unenviable· l_ight before \nthe public. Have they been fairly dealt with 1 If their \nnames are published why not the names of those who \nvoted, and the amendments, if any, that were proposed 1 \nDo those who refuse to vote for decency and for keeping \nan honourable and great Organisation free from affilia­\ntion with street blackguardism wish to work from behind \nit hedge 1 Surely it is reasonable that those who have \nattempted to affiliate the Gaelic League to street black­\nguardism should be asked to do so in the light of day. \nWe ask for light and ventilation on this matter. As the \nnames of the proposer and seconder of the resolution that \nhas been passed-a resolution that has made the situa­\ntion worse than ever-have been published in the official \norgan, it is all the more reason that full publicity should \nbe given; and that an account of the amendments, if ,., \nany, and of the voting should be published. The olack­\nguards laid contribution on a policeman to remove Dr. \nMcWalter 's carriage from the Procession; we could, if \nwe choose, place at least one or two of these blackguards \nand whom we could identify, in the dock; but though \nthey sought the aid of a policeman we refrain from put­\nting the police upon them ; these are the fellows who \nopenly acted in the name of the League that a majority \n• of the Executive at the last meeting declined to con­\ndemn.

As the \nnames of the proposer and seconder of the resolution that \nhas been passed-a resolution that has made the situa­\ntion worse than ever-have been published in the official \norgan, it is all the more reason that full publicity should \nbe given; and that an account of the amendments, if ,., \nany, and of the voting should be published. The olack­\nguards laid contribution on a policeman to remove Dr. \nMcWalter 's carriage from the Procession; we could, if \nwe choose, place at least one or two of these blackguards \nand whom we could identify, in the dock; but though \nthey sought the aid of a policeman we refrain from put­\nting the police upon them ; these are the fellows who \nopenly acted in the name of the League that a majority \n• of the Executive at the last meeting declined to con­\ndemn. We suggest that the public are entitled to a \nbrief account of what took place at the Executive \nmeeting and an account of the votes recorded. \nFather J. O'Dea, C .C., Loughrea, C o.

Winifred O'Brien, f1Shbuyer, Arklow, wm, \nso enterprising as to place a special agent at Howth \nto supply orders for her. On Tuesday, 18th Oc­\ntober last, her agent consigned at Howth 5 barrels of \nmadcerel to a. customer at Wa.terforcl. The fish were \ndespatched, it is believed, by the 10.55 a.m. tr.a.in from \nIlowth Oil tha,t clay. Th ey did not, however, reach \n·waterford till 'l'huraclay, the 20th October, and were \nthen in an unsa,lea.ble condition, n-ncl had to be sold for \nma.uure. \"On a claim being sent to the Grea,t Northern \nR:tilway Compa -ny as being t,he company by whom the \nfish were consigned, tha.t company refused to pa,y the \nclaim. Theil' goods mann.ger, writing from B elfast l!nder \nelate 14th January, states that-\" Tho fish got the ordi­\nnary goocl,s tra-in service from Ilowth to \"IVa.terford, but \nif your client wanted them delivered iil ·waterford on the \n19th October (i.e., tho following day), she should have \ninstructed her agent to forward them by passenger train. \nAs Waterford is a, statioil on tho Great SoutJhern and \n·wes tern Railwa,y, wo did wha;t was perfectly proper in \nhandiilg over to the latter company at Duhliil.\" I must \nt,herefore roopectfully decliile to eiltertain aily claim in \nt-he matter.\" \n\\Ve ilow have it officia.Jly that it ta-kes tw o who le days \nto get fish from Howth to Waterford by the Great Sou­\nthern a.ud ,~·estern R a-ilway's goods train. It would be \niuteresting to know wheil the \\Vaterforcl fish would have \nre.ached their destination if consigned by the Dublin a.ncl \nWicklo,'1 Railway, which now nm s to \"IVaterford, and I \ninvite the mailager of that company to give us some in­\nformation on the poiut. \nThe Groat Northern Railway manag er's suggestion: \nthaL w e should have cOilfilgiled by passenger traiu is in­\nstrucbi ve. Railway companies always wailt fish sent b)r \npassenger tra-in, at passenger rates, of course. But the-se­\npassenger i-a,tes are so exorbitant that they leave the \nconsignors no profit, and so kill trade. \nFrom the return of tho Boa-rd of Tracie just pt\\blished \nit appea~s that the tal,e of fish iil Scotland last year was \nseven aud a half millioil huildredweights, while the take \nin Irelailcl was only a quarter of a million. Considoriilg \nthat the sea coast of Irela-nd is much larger than Scot­\nJ.a.ud, the difference is startling. \"When we Jiild, how­\ne~er, that the largest ra-ilway compa -ny iil Ireland ta.kes \ntwo days to carry fish a little over 100 miles, the alarming \ncli1Ierence between the fishing return of ScotJaucl aild Ire· \nland seems capa,ble of explanation. \nThe question of the East Coast Fisheries is exercising \nthe public m ind a.t preseilt, and we a-re promised legisla,. \ntioil Qll the matter. Let us hope that somet11ing ma y be \ndone to improve the so-called facilities of transit, which \nw e have at preseilt, a11d enable buyers of commodities, \nsuch as fish, t.o put their wa.res on the mM·ket before they \nbecom e unsa.Jea,ble. • GEORGE F.

Bra.yden, the \nEditor of t,he truly nationa.J Freeman, was at the recent \nGod-Save-the-King dinner of so-called Irish journalists \nwho a.re members of the British Institute of Journa.lists. \nMr. R. Donovan, who, •We believe, is a mighty \" leader \" \nwriter in the Simply Deplo,·able, was aJso at this dinner \nwhen~ \"The King \" was toasted. W~1at in a. S,:,,nz,fy \nDeplorable man is but a, trifle, even if it is that, is flat \ntreason in a. weak-kneed District, Councillor in a corner. \nMessrs. Brayden andl Don ova.n may go to God-Save-the­\nKing dinners, but there is another law for the District \n;~nd municipal Councillors. They must be death-or-glory \nmen when they are in a, corner. We , as our reade)'s \nknow , have no sympathy with fulsome, loya,I a.dd1·essers, \nthough we suspect that if it is weakness that creates a \nfulsome, loyal addresser, it is often wea.kness that creates \nthe toy death-or-glory non-addresser; the one bows to one \nmob, and the other to another; intrinsically, the one is \noften no better than theother. But,a.nywa.y, there ought \nto be the sa.me law for Mr. Brayden a.nd Mr. Donovan \nof t,he Pretmwi as for t-he District Counci,Jlor. \"Honest \n,John,\" who never lifted ,his voice on the floor of the \nBoardroom of the Grea.t Northern RaHway on behalf of \nthe oppressed a.nd. excluded Catholics, but who recently \nga.ve a kick to tho\" under clog,\" the Catholic Association, \nwent clown to Blackrock.

Donovan, who, •We believe, is a mighty \" leader \" \nwriter in the Simply Deplo,·able, was aJso at this dinner \nwhen~ \"The King \" was toasted. W~1at in a. S,:,,nz,fy \nDeplorable man is but a, trifle, even if it is that, is flat \ntreason in a. weak-kneed District, Councillor in a corner. \nMessrs. Brayden andl Don ova.n may go to God-Save-the­\nKing dinners, but there is another law for the District \n;~nd municipal Councillors. They must be death-or-glory \nmen when they are in a, corner. We , as our reade)'s \nknow , have no sympathy with fulsome, loya,I a.dd1·essers, \nthough we suspect that if it is weakness that creates a \nfulsome, loyal addresser, it is often wea.kness that creates \nthe toy death-or-glory non-addresser; the one bows to one \nmob, and the other to another; intrinsically, the one is \noften no better than theother. But,a.nywa.y, there ought \nto be the sa.me law for Mr. Brayden a.nd Mr. Donovan \nof t,he Pretmwi as for t-he District Counci,Jlor. \"Honest \n,John,\" who never lifted ,his voice on the floor of the \nBoardroom of the Grea.t Northern RaHway on behalf of \nthe oppressed a.nd. excluded Catholics, but who recently \nga.ve a kick to tho\" under clog,\" the Catholic Association, \nwent clown to Blackrock.

Winifred O'Brien, f1Shbuyer, Arklow, wm, \nso enterprising as to place a special agent at Howth \nto supply orders for her. On Tuesday, 18th Oc­\ntober last, her agent consigned at Howth 5 barrels of \nmadcerel to a. customer at Wa.terforcl. The fish were \ndespatched, it is believed, by the 10.55 a.m. tr.a.in from \nIlowth Oil tha,t clay. Th ey did not, however, reach \n·waterford till 'l'huraclay, the 20th October, and were \nthen in an unsa,lea.ble condition, n-ncl had to be sold for \nma.uure. \"On a claim being sent to the Grea,t Northern \nR:tilway Compa -ny as being t,he company by whom the \nfish were consigned, tha.t company refused to pa,y the \nclaim. Theil' goods mann.ger, writing from B elfast l!nder \nelate 14th January, states that-\" Tho fish got the ordi­\nnary goocl,s tra-in service from Ilowth to \"IVa.terford, but \nif your client wanted them delivered iil ·waterford on the \n19th October (i.e., tho following day), she should have \ninstructed her agent to forward them by passenger train. \nAs Waterford is a, statioil on tho Great SoutJhern and \n·wes tern Railwa,y, wo did wha;t was perfectly proper in \nhandiilg over to the latter company at Duhliil.\" I must \nt,herefore roopectfully decliile to eiltertain aily claim in \nt-he matter.\" \n\\Ve ilow have it officia.Jly that it ta-kes tw o who le days \nto get fish from Howth to Waterford by the Great Sou­\nthern a.ud ,~·estern R a-ilway's goods train. It would be \niuteresting to know wheil the \\Vaterforcl fish would have \nre.ached their destination if consigned by the Dublin a.ncl \nWicklo,'1 Railway, which now nm s to \"IVaterford, and I \ninvite the mailager of that company to give us some in­\nformation on the poiut. \nThe Groat Northern Railway manag er's suggestion: \nthaL w e should have cOilfilgiled by passenger traiu is in­\nstrucbi ve. Railway companies always wailt fish sent b)r \npassenger tra-in, at passenger rates, of course. But the-se­\npassenger i-a,tes are so exorbitant that they leave the \nconsignors no profit, and so kill trade. \nFrom the return of tho Boa-rd of Tracie just pt\\blished \nit appea~s that the tal,e of fish iil Scotland last year was \nseven aud a half millioil huildredweights, while the take \nin Irelailcl was only a quarter of a million. Considoriilg \nthat the sea coast of Irela-nd is much larger than Scot­\nJ.a.ud, the difference is startling. \"When we Jiild, how­\ne~er, that the largest ra-ilway compa -ny iil Ireland ta.kes \ntwo days to carry fish a little over 100 miles, the alarming \ncli1Ierence between the fishing return of ScotJaucl aild Ire· \nland seems capa,ble of explanation. \nThe question of the East Coast Fisheries is exercising \nthe public m ind a.t preseilt, and we a-re promised legisla,. \ntioil Qll the matter. Let us hope that somet11ing ma y be \ndone to improve the so-called facilities of transit, which \nw e have at preseilt, a11d enable buyers of commodities, \nsuch as fish, t.o put their wa.res on the mM·ket before they \nbecom e unsa.Jea,ble. • GEORGE F.

For, when our holy faith was ba,nnecl, \nwhen the cotmtry was deluged with gore, when our fore­\nfathers had to cede their birthright to the \"jumper\" and \nthe stranger, and hide themselves in d-ark cavern or fly \nfor sa.fety to the mounta.ins, when our churches were dis.­\nmantled and -0ur altars broken, when the nation was \nstrangled, and all that was great a.nd noble dro,wned in \nblood, their traditional devotion to Mary kept the olden \nfaith alive to all tha.t was left of the frish ra.ce: -\nThis is, indeed, the Blessed Mary 's land \nOur faith a.nd ra.ce survive through her right haml. \nDevotion to Mary is part of the National life in Irela.oJ \n-throbbing with the people·'s heart a,nd coursing wit.h \ntheir blood, And it is this devotion that a ha,ndful of \ninsolent Presbyterians insulted here in W e-stport lately. \nT o point the insult, . they selected the time· when ~he \nCatholic Ohurch throuahout the world was honouring \n1,he Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. They \naot a wretched creature from Scotland~a .land tha~ is \nthe shame -0f Eu:tope for immorality-and sent -him into \nthe humble h-Oimes of -0ur p-0or but virtuous flock to tell \nthem that the Ohurch of Roi:ne 1had pushed Christ into \na. second place, that she ·h.ad dragged_ him down from \nHis Throne -0f Glory and set up Ma .ry instead, and tha-t \n·our dev-0tion to the Immacula ,te Mother of 'God-the \ndevotion of our race,· the devotion of our ma -rtyred fore­\nfathers, t'he devotio~ th.at is deep in the Irish he,ar~ \nthat our devotion to the Immaculate Mother of God 1s \nnothii.ng .fbut _u.nblushi!lg bl_a-?}>~e,m)'.'. Where is ~he \n.Irish priest, with an Insh spmt m Ins breast and Insh \nblood· in his veins, tha,t could l-0ok cold.ly on a-ncl ~eav~ \nhis ,chastisement to another 1 I am not that priest. \nFather McDonald went on:-\" Woha .t hapened then you \n• know alre.ady.· I want you now to mark wha:t followed. \nThat · evening the police suggested to the B1 ble reader \nthat he sh-0uld summon me, but he declined and called \non the police themselves, to take· up the case. They d0-\nclined also a.nd there the matter ended. One week \npassed by and no summons · came, two weeks passed by \nand not one word about it; three weeks passed by, four \nweeks passed by, five weeks p~d by and all was for­\ng-otten. But suddenly one mornmg . t:Jhe welcome news \nreached Belfast. The Orange newspapers we-nti mad \nwith delight and commanded the Governm~nf; to prose­\ncute the priest, and tl1e Government forthwith, the very \n•:17N8 FISHING TAOlt'LE Flne.t qaalit,, ob01ope1t In tho Xlngdoa. \nBeat T~oot J1'U11, Irl9h Tied, '114 per do■ . 1llu1tn.ted Oat&logue of Gun, or \nPi1blng Taoltle, poat free. 1,, Keegau, G11ll and F11hlng Taokle Kan• \nfactaror, 36 Upper Onnond Qaa1, nohlbl. \nnext day obeyed the order and the priest was _prosecu_te~ \n(groa-ns). N-0t at the suit -of the wre~'hed Bible readei \n-he swore on 1his oath that he declined to prosecute, \nnot. at the requesb of the police a.uthorities-:he sw-0re \nthat they a.Jso declined, but because the Orangemen \nof Belfast demanded it. Bub, as your address says, I \ncame out of the prosecution with 1~ono~ an_d glory \nwhile -my opponents were covered with 1gn~mmy and \nconfusion. It is the old, oid story, Belfast 1s Irelan~. \nIf Ireland -needs .a, Land Bill, Belfast blocks the way, ~f \nIrela,nd calls for .a University, Belfast blocks the way, 1f \nfr.eland demands Home Rule, Belfast blocks the way. \nIrda.ucl is governed not from W estnninster, nor even \nfrom Dubli.n Castle, but from and for the Orang~ \nLodges of Belfast (groans). The relations between Bel­\nfast a-ncl Ireland bear striking resemblances to t~e con­\nduct -0f a cruel step-mother towards her s~p-c~ildr~n . \nThis Irish step-motlher :has long experience 1~ J1b~llmg \n~he children -0£ the, soil in order to secure their heritage \nfor her own . She is horrified because the Catholics of \nWest-port did not reooive the man Ma.cAskill with open \narms, a.ncl strnighl:raw~-r ~be _pl.ays h~r old game an.d \nproceeds to blacken this chstnct and 1ts people. Hern \naJ.·e the bra,zen libels :-'Let Ulster Protesta,nts make \nno misl:a-ke. There is no security for the life or pro­\npe1;ty of P1·otes•tanis in the South and ·west of Ireland. \nOiitside the few districts where they are stJ.,ong enough \nto protect themselves ·they exist only by effacing them­\nselves from the public view.' Now , for every Protesta.nt \nin bhe parish of Westport there a.re 16 Catholics and \none of t,hem is able for a Protestant any clay. The Pro­\ntestants<; then must be in a poor plight, their lives and \nproperty in jeopa;rdy, since they are not strong enough \nto protect .themselves. But what are the actual facts 1 \nWhy, every inah of property that is in it is in the hands \nof Protesta,nts, and every position with a !handsome \nsalary is filled with one of them. They :have the fat of \nthe land and the cream of the commerce·, and instead of \nhaving to efface themselves they live in comfort on the \nsweat of Cabholics a.nd thrive on their pati-ona.ge. These \nfacts a,re known to the Protestants of the district great \na.nd smaJl, and still they aJ.·e content to allo,w suoh gross \nlibels -on their Catholic neighbours to travel round the \ntlu-ee -kingdoms without a. word of prote&t. They have \nbeen ca,lled upon by every public body in the county \nto contndictJ and repudia.te them, but neither cont.ra.­\ndicti-011 nor repudi.ation is forthcoming. It was for \ntheir interest tha.t the Ca.tholics were libelled and the \ndistrict defamed, and I now tell them plainly that in \n• 1Jheir refusaJ to contra,clict and repudiate, there is neither \ntruth, nor honour, 'llOr justice,. It may not be expe­\ndient to deprive Mr. Sloan of his weapons in Parliament, \nbut. to keep back the truth or withhold ib in such a, case \nis cowardly and cr:imina.l.\" Further on Father \nMcDonald said: --\"But endurance has its limits, a,nd \nthe day ha.s come, henceforth we wi.Jl lift our heads and \nasse-rb our rights, and we will be slaves no longer in our \nown -land. Intolerance will be taught a; lesson, tJhere \nwill be levelling up and levelling down, hostile a.sceu­\ndancy must give way. But no honest -man need fea;r, \nno ma.tter what his creed.

The action \nis stayed now aml t'hen by quaint and ,humorous scenes \nbetwwu the Icing's servrunts after the manner o.f \nShaJcspere, and there are also two scenes where a, woman \nof the Sidhe is int-,rodu.cecl as tempting Brian and his \nson successively to the ignoble ]ifo of unreal ease among \nthe Sid'he. O.ne migl1L possibly construe these' scenes \nas a satire on some of t,he a,ulihors of the literary theatre·, \nbut the general view was tha.t they were somewhat of an \nexcrescence, aud •had better be left out-, of the drama. \nThe play is really made up of ·two parts--BTian and \nGormleith. Both are strongly and sympathetically \ndraw n, but La,dy Gregory ha-s shown herself mercile~ in \nher delineation of the female character. Brian is with \nLady Gregory wha .t Henry V. is with Shakspere-the \nmigh-Ly wa,rrior a,nd the perfect man ; the gi•eat national \na-nd Ohrist-,iau hero. His character is idealised through­\nout/; so much iclea-lised, indeed, that the student o.f his­\ntory maY:, perhaps, find himself a little perplexed.

A!.1 unfair but too prevalent notion that 1Jheir \ncla.i~s to ~refer-e.nce rested lll'ore on patriotio -tthain eco­\nnom1c cons1deratio-ns. If the advocacy of tho ','as good \nand as chea~\" the,ory as the sa,fos~ general principle to \nbe aidoptoo m rega,rd to supportma Irish-made aoods \n. ha.d no other recommonda.tion t,ha,1~ its efficacy ;s an \nargument to destroy this prejudice, it would still have \nmuch justificaition. With regard to bheoo Irish-ma.de \numbrel-las,. it is claimed that in asking a, preference for \nt,hem as Insh ma:irnfa.cture, Messrs. Smyth and Son only \ndo so ou the basis that they are a,t least equal in price \nan? quaJity to those imported. TiJ.1e mak ers lay stress on \ntins fea.t,ure, as t,hey ha,ve found prevailing in some \nqua.rters an t~njust and injurious impression that they \nare m.t ~pensive house. On the cont.rary, they maint:Jain \ntha.t they readily keep a.breast of the cheapenina ten­\ndency of the times, a.nd tha,t thei1· ma .nufa.cture ~an be \nbought a,t prices suitable to every pocket. As a.n \nexample, they point out that they make both ladies and \ngentlemen's, umbr ellas as chea.p as 2s. 6d. each. They \na.Iso m~ke a. specia.lit;y of ladies fancy umbrellas at the· \nlow pnce of 4s. 6d., whilst t;heir Irish-made sunshades• \ncan be had from 2s. 6d. upwa .rds. A half-crown for \nwha .t a firm of repute affirms is a good reliable article \nseems to go down to the bed-rock of economy, and be­\ntween these low-priced ones and the deM·er kinds which \nrange to a.bout 30s. for sunshades a.nd 70s. for umbr ellas, \nthe purchaser of an Irish-made umbrella .. or pa.rasol is \nafforded a great variety of choice. 0 . \nLISTOWEL UNIO.N AND IRISH BLANKETS. \nIn an .advertis-ement of the Listowel Union inviting \ntenders f.o:r clo,t,hing, we read : - \"By Order of 1:ihe \nGuardi ans, a.I! .Al.-1:,icles of Clothing and Ma ,teria.ls sup­\nplied must be of Irish manufacture, and the name 9f \nthe Ma.nufa.cturiing Firm shall be stated.

It \nis not stU'prising that at a, subsequenti meet­\ning of the Listowel Board, tlhe question was brou~h~ up \nfor discussion. Mr. E. J.

CHANEL. \n_.,__.__._.: .. : ................ \nTHE CATHOLIC TRUTH SOCIETY OF IRELAND. \n' .... , - HERE is dissatisfaction in the country a.t the \nmanner in which the Catholic T'rutb Society is \nworked--or, perba.ps it would be more correcb to sa,y, not \nworked. The Society was st-a,rted about five yea.rs a.go. \nThe Irish Bishops not only gave it their a,pprobation, but \nit was advocated in many Pa.storals. B1·anches were es­\n·ta.blished in every diocese, and these not only in la.rge \ntowns but even in remote districts. Catholic Truth \nboxes were to be seen in almost every church; the publi­\n.ca.tions were largely bought up. In the coru·se of the in­\naugural address-in November, 1899--of the president, \nt-he present Arch bishop of Tua.m, his Gra.ce said : -\" The \nmain object of tfie Society is, as its na.me implies, the \n-diffusion, by means of cheap publications, of sound Cath­\nolic literature in popular form, so as to give insti:uctjon \na.nd edification in a mauner most likely to interest aml \nattract the general reader. It is well known that va.rious \nprinting presses in Great Britain da,ily pour out a. flood of \ninfidel and immoral publications, some of which over­\nflows to this country. vVe ha,ve a confident hope that \nthe Society's publications will remove the temptation _of \nhaving recourse to such filthy garbage, will create a taste \nfor a pure a.nd wholesome literature, and will a,lso serve \n.as an antidote against the poison of dangerous or im-\nmoral wi-itings.\" • \nNotwithstanding tha-t the publica.tions set out in the, \nfirst catalogue. were chiefly composed of reprints of 1his­\ntorical, devotiona,l and other works familia.r to -an older \ngeneration, they were new to many. The Society owed it~ \nimmediate origin to a paper read by the Rev. D1·. O 'Rio,r­\ndan, of Limerick, at the Maynooth Union of 1899, and \nit was at once successful beyond all expectations. But \nsocieties must march forward with the times; a constant \n.supply of new a.nd original works is necessary, and if \nthey are not procured it is only fair to ask the manage­\nment the reason why. As it is we hear tha,t the boxes \n·in many parishes have been closed. In a paper read by \nMr. R. ,J. Kelly, B.L., a.t the last Conference, he said:­\n\" Thus the boxes were in many places not kept up to \n-date-not filled with fresh supplies of book;;-and in too \nmany cases they were allowed to become the receptacle \nfor dog-eared, weather-beaten, dirt-covered books, tha.t \nonly repelled the public. And so, in too ma .ny instances \n·that came undeir my -own observ.ation even, have the \nboxes so kept become the means of inducing the public \n·to believe the Society was dead, or if not dead, in so \n·moribund a state that it; cn.nn.ot supply bool{S any \n'longer.'' It is all very well to blame_ the, brnx:ea. But is the \n•,state of some of these boxes a leadmg · cause of the state \n-of affairs of the Catholic Truth Society of Ireland 7 Does \nnot the gre·at respo•nsibility for the existing state of \n·things rest with the committee of management in no·t \nproviding the necessary variety of books to meet the \nwants of the reading public concer-ned 1 . There ~~-e \nplenty of writers, but perhaps they a!'e no~ m touch ~ti; \nthe committee. Surely it would not ho d1fficuJ.t L? br m_o \nabout a state of aJiairs ·that writers would submit then· \nworks to the Society just a-s articles ,a.re submit~d to an \neditor; and if there was a go-ahead mana.gement it ~ould \ninspire a go-a.head writing public. lt is, .a.,; we said, all \nvery well to blame the box:es, but what can the clergy ~r \nobhers do whose business it is to look after the boxes 1f \nthey .are unable, by action or inaction of the ma.nag-e­\nment, to get suita.bl.e supplies of books? The last annWLl \nwas a big volum.e cont,a,ining ma .ny photograp'hs, some ex­\ncellent; articles, and a large number of \nnames of t110se present. Sixpence in Ireland \nis .a rathe,r prohibitive price· for read~ng matte1:- 'l:1e \nfamous address by his Lordship the Bishop of L1meri~k \non University Education would have made a splenchd \npenny pamphlet ior.the Ca.tholic Truth boxes; as an item \nin the .annual at sixpence it was sentenced, as it :\"'ere, to \na very limited circula.tion; and we assume that sixpenny \npublications cam10t be placed in the boxes. The same \nremark a.pplies to the paper ''Protestantism and Pros­\nperity in Ireland,\" by itihe Rev. Dom . P . No-Ian, \nO.S.B., and R.ev. Dr. O 'R.iordan's• contribution to the \ndiscussion that followed it. These two papers w ere \nworthy of the very widest circula,tjon, but mixed up in a \nsixpenny volume with other articles of .less public in­\nterest, they were sent into the world with -a millstone \nrouna their necks. vVe have no brief for or a.gainst the \nSociety. vVe would like to see it vigorously doing the \nwork tiha,t it was started to do, but we fear iJhe,re is much \nroom for dissa.tisfaction at the way in which affairs are \ngoing 011. P erhaps, some of those who are de-eply in­\nterested in, a,nd informed about, the Society would let us \nha.ve their view s for publication. Vv e have published \nseveral contributed articles from time to time, a.nd at \nthe moment a few mild doses of a tonic in the shape of \npublic discussio,n would not do the public nor the \nMa:nagemenrt:. Committee any haJ·m. \n~•:••:• ............... \nTHEl ORANGE \"Ili'V'INOIBLES.\" \n0 \nN the 6th Ma;y, 1882, the Irisli Chief Secretary and \n1 \nthe Under-Secretary were stabbed to death in the \nPhrenix Parle The crime sent a thrill of horror through­\nou-t Ireland a.nd Grea,t Brita.in, and, indeed, throughout \nthe \" civilized wo'r!d,\" if one may use that expression \nwithout infringing copyright. The assassins were held \nup to execration, a.ud the whole cha.meter of the nation \nwas deemed disgraced by the dreadful deed. Despite the \nefforts of. the pa.rty• of Law and Order, however, it was \nfound, impossible to implicate the leader:s of the National \nMovement in the crime. The representa,tives of Law \na.nd Order, though 1-elying on forgers, perjurers, a.nd \nspies as their a!lies, and though trying their case before \na prejudiced British tribuua.l, failed to pi'<lve tha.t their \nopponents had expressed a post hoc sympa ,thy with the \nmurderers. Th~e wretched men received sympa,thy \nfrom no qua,rter; deserved none. Yet it should be \nborn~ in mind that what they did, they did for no per­\nson.a.I encl.

The March \nNumber of Inisf ail is very interesting.

Perhaps the editor of lnisfail, \nwhoever -he ma ,y be, is also a,n embryo Judge Keogh ! \nMr. Morris, of the Executive, had better look after him . \nPerhaps, this \"perverse carping and cynica,l criiticism\" \nfrom Inisf ail is intended to da.mn the Irish Langua,ge \nCoHection, and Mr. A. J. Nicoll, o-f Dublin Cast:le, bad \nbetter come to the rescue.

We shall keep our eyes on its lapses, \n,call it tci account in due course, ana make it try to jus-­\ntify itself in a style mor.e worthy of a,n intellectual mov e­\nment.\" Well , if we are Judge Keoghs Inisfail must be \nedited by L e Carron! Mr. P . T. Daly, T.C., should pro­\nceed at once to London, accompanied by Mr. A. J. \nNicolls, of Dublin Castle The Irish Language Cause is \nsurely being undermined by this foul organ of the London \nGaelic League! We are only playing second fiddle in \ntreacherous iniquity to Ini.'Jfa•il. \nThe ,re ,bas been quite a controve•rsy in tJhe Dmidalk \nDemocrat about the LEADER; it .a,rose out of the anony­\nmous fulminations written by a Nrr. H enry Morris, who \nis also a member of the Executive of the Gaelic League. \n\\Ve note that this Mr . Henry Morr.is, writing as ''we\" in \nour l!Jundalk contemporary, lets fly to tho extent of \na.bout two colUJlilns, :i.n the issue of February 25th, by \nwa ,y of reply to two· lette,rs tlw:t ha.cl appea,red in a pre­\nvious issue of that paper.

And bhe writer o.f the notes in our \nDundalk oonte.mporary, who is shocked .at our \"scur­\nrility,\" couples us neatly, as· it will have been observed, \nwj.th a chimney sweep! The best thing of all, however, \nis the suggestion that.t:Jhe officia,l editor is afraid to notice \nus, as if he did, ·we might give him a nickname! Picture \na ma,n going into Irish. pwblic life weighed down with \na morbid dread that some one wo uld give •him a nick­\nname 1. Pictm·e the official editor bei,ng offered a brief \nin the Courts. We see him in om: mind's eye w eighing \nup the probwbilities of being called a nickname by the \nopposing counsel; if Tim Hea .ly were ou !Jhe other side, \nhe might consider the risk too great, a.nd might decline \nthe brief. Now if tlhe ·official editor is really in dread of \na nicknam e, he has no reaso·n to be thankful to this \nMr. Morris for lett.iug :bhe, cat out of the bag; for it is \nrumost like offering a. prize to the country for the best. \nnickname for the official editor. \nHere is a grave -indictment from this Mr . Morris:­\n\"Are .not the editorial columns of the LEADER master­\npieces of vituperation 1 Is there a single Irish paper \nhas invented a.nd used morn nick,names durino-the \nfour and a half yea.rs of its existence than the L~ADER \nhas done? Why it would fill coh1mns of ,t.his paper if we \nmade a. compilation of all il1e nickna.mes the LEADE R \nhas ,invented and made use of.\" Well, we certainly wilt \nmake a. clean breast of it, and admit that we did invent \nsome JJicknam es in our time. We believe it was we \nwho nicknamed a certn.in portion of -Lliis nation \"Irish \nIreland.\" We certainly have it on om· conscience tihat \nwe invented \"Sourfaoe\" and \"Saved\"; we first nicknamed \nbhe publicn,ns of this country \"Bung ,\" and c.'\\.lled a type \nof manufactm·ers \"Dark Bro!Jhers.\" We nicknamed n, \noortn.i:n cla.ss of writing-perhaps this Mr. Morris is \ngetting fidgety here-we nicknamed a, certn.in class of \nwriting ''ra:imeis\"--01h, no doubt about it, we have been \ngrea.t sinners ,iin the nicknaming ,line and no mistake .. \nAnd the ,rorst of it is tilrn.t the nickmwn es we ·have in­\nvented so· far are, we trust, nothing to those tha.t ,ve \nhope we will be, inspire-cl to iinvent as Ume goes on. \nA fair indication of the calibre and bra,i,ns and level­\nheadedness of this co1'1--espondent of om· Dunda.Jlc con­\ntemporary who is .a, member of the Executive of the \nGaelfo League, may be judged by one pa,rticula.rly bright; \nsuggestJion. He is talking of \"some friends,\" whoever \nthey ma.y be, of 1:Jhe LEADER, and he says :-\"Sinoe \ntihen tbe®e have avowed the intoution, a.ncl appa.reutly­\n·still oherish the· idea, of destroying the Claidheami1, \nSol-it.is .and m aki-t1g tlbe LEADER the mouthpiece o.f the \nGaelic Len,gue. lile.nce those atta,cks on the officinI \norga.n, ostensil>ly i,n U1e interests of the public.\" Of \ncom-se ·this ·twaddle need only ho pr.inted to be pro;vecI \nn,?sur~ ;_ hut beyond its inhereint .absUl'dity; it shows a \nd1spos1t10on to see ''plots\" .and \"sohemes\" auid such like, \na disposition, u,nhappily, too prevalenb in this half-slave,. \na,nd over-suspicious coutrtry, and wihich causes a, lot of \navoicln.ble mischief.

Why? Your contributor's re­\nference to vulgarity and sweeps is not a sufficient ex­\nplanation. • Let me show this. About a year ago, I \nrememb er the editor of t,he Claidheannh •allowed the woi·d \nLEADER to appear in ·his columns .and also condescended \nto a.nswe-r some of it.<, criticisms. Now w.asn't the \nLEADER as scunilous and as vulga-r then as now, and I \nexpect the Claidheamih was every bit as re-fined. Then, \nrecently. the Claidheamh had occasion to iiefer to an \narticle that. appeared in tihe LEADER, a.n.d i-t referred to­\nthait article as appearing in a 'contemporary.' There · \nwas no occasion _for controversy 11ere, no reason to \navoid 1Jhe scurrilous tongue of the LEADER; but I sup­\npose the name of the low-down sheet would defile tJhe \nimmaculate columns of the Claidheamlb T Such childish­\nness! • Again, the LEADER, more than a, montJh ag(?• \nasked a. few simple, stra.ight questions; .asked them i•~ \na fair, open way, without ,a,ny scurrility or any display \nof vulgai:ity. I think the Claidheamh ,had a. right to \na.nswer them, a,nd if rij; had I .suppose we w-ould \nhave no. such row ,as this. But then, who would' mind \nthe questions of a. sweep 1 A ·sweep is all right when he \nclellins your chimneys a_nd ventiJ.ates your house, .but; \nto address you in pwb:lic-ug,h I The LEADER . has ven-\n' tila.ood the Irish Ireland house fairly well, and I sup-\nMARCH 11. 190_5 .. \np~se .as long as it keeps on the old clothes it worked so \n,wel1 in, it must be content with a sweep's treatment. \nNo;\\V,. as an humble Gaelic Lea-guer, I ask-Why does \nthe Claidhean~h Sol'ltis boycott, the LEADER and at the \nsame time· dub another weekly organ its 'confrere 1' As \nI have shown, the refinement of the editor is no .a.nswer. \nIn my humble judgment, the· Claiaheamh a.nd ~ts 'con­\nf1-ere' are under ·Lhe influence of the same clique.\" • \nWe ma,ke no a1~Iogy for quoting two furth,?r J.?a.ra;: \ngrnphs from this letter in reply to some of the poi.nts \nurged by this Mr. Monis of ,the Executive:-\" The \nLEADER is more Ca;t:Jho.Jic than the Cwtholic Hierarchy. \nThe same rema.rk would .apply to a Monta.lambert, or a, \nLacordaire, or ,an O 'Connell, or to any Catholic layman \nwh.o stood out boldly a defender· of Oatholi~ interest,s. \nAnyhow , on whwt is that charge based 1 Ou its suppo-rt, \nof the Ca,tholic A ssociation! Well the Democrat at a \nvery cri.tica,I period of the .A.s.5ociation's ca,reer supported \nit also, .and :there are many 'clergymen strong suppo-rters \nof it.

From la.te \nhappenings it appear8 t-hat one-time t,errible rebels ·have \ncollared him also. This is .a curious charge to come from \nanyone who has watched the attitude of the L EAD ER to­\nwards the King .\" • \n~ight we add tha,t if the CL<11ue ,~1i1 Soltttr were an \norchuary pa~Jer run at one ma ,n's risk or several men 's \nrisk_, that we wo~ld have no more compla.int at its ig­\nnormg our quest1ons, the while it called a rnbid poli­\ntical organ its \"confrere,\" that we would a.t the \nsilly boycott of ourselves by the Dublin \"truly na­\ntionals.\" The Dublin \"truly na,tiouals\" iJJ.ave mad e \nthemselves ridiculous by their boycott of us but they \nare quite within their right in boycotting us.'

Perhaps the editor of lnisfail, \nwhoever -he ma ,y be, is also a,n embryo Judge Keogh ! \nMr. Morris, of the Executive, had better look after him . \nPerhaps, this \"perverse carping and cynica,l criiticism\" \nfrom Inisf ail is intended to da.mn the Irish Langua,ge \nCoHection, and Mr. A.

Mr. P . T. Daly, T.C., should pro­\nceed at once to London, accompanied by Mr. A. J. \nNicolls, of Dublin Castle The Irish Language Cause is \nsurely being undermined by this foul organ of the London \nGaelic League! We are only playing second fiddle in \ntreacherous iniquity to Ini.'Jfa•il. \nThe ,re ,bas been quite a controve•rsy in tJhe Dmidalk \nDemocrat about the LEADER; it .a,rose out of the anony­\nmous fulminations written by a Nrr. H enry Morris, who \nis also a member of the Executive of the Gaelic League. \n\\Ve note that this Mr . Henry Morr.is, writing as ''we\" in \nour l!Jundalk contemporary, lets fly to tho extent of \na.bout two colUJlilns, :i.n the issue of February 25th, by \nwa ,y of reply to two· lette,rs tlw:t ha.cl appea,red in a pre­\nvious issue of that paper. It is no-ne of our busi,ness to \nintrnd~ very muchi in the, controversy going on in \na.uother paper, but there are a few tlii.ngs i,n the two \ncolumns of notes to wbioh we have refer,recl that amused \nus, and which may also amuse our readers. The w1·iter \nof the notes, as we ,have said, is a. membe ,r of the E .xecu­\n.t,ive, and, tberefo-re knows something of the inner \nwol'king. He evidenbly knows why the mighty official \norgan, that cost the:• Language Fund £1,091 fo reoonb \nyears, turns up ite ·haughty nose at us; what is more, \nhe has bltwted out his knowledge . We l'ea.d :-\"Now \nas :lo the silence of the Cl~i<lheamh Soluis. 'I;he' \nGlaidheaml,.. So.vr.iis is sile.nt iu pursuance o.f .a ·po-hey. \nwhich we thiu•k is w,rono-. The editor of tihe Claidheamh, : \nwe belie,ve., holds that \n0\nbecause ohe joun:ialisl:iic sLyle 0£' \ntlhe LEADER is O'f a vulgar, scm·1ilous type, he can,1;1ot. \nenter into, contro,vexsey with it. But, even acoep!Jing; \nthis summing up of the situation, if the ec;l.i:to:r ot ili.e \nClaid11ea1nli were aJtacked by a chimney sweep, would \nhe walk on n,nd allow the sweep ·to co,ntinue 1,h,e attack,. \nlesb he migihti get soUed and blackened in the melee~ \nHe would not, neith.ei• should •he, we hold, allow the­\nLEADEn's attacks to go unchallenged, even though he­\nmight be ca.Jled some ugly nicknames, and •have a lot of \ncoarse fun poked at his hea.d.\" All this is really de­\nlighLiul. So we are Loo \"vulgar\" and \"scurrilous\" to• \nbe spoken to by the highly respectx1,ble and ve,ry \":tony\" \nofficia.J editor! And bhe writer o.f the notes in our \nDundalk oonte.mporary, who is shocked .at our \"scur­\nrility,\" couples us neatly, as· it will have been observed, \nwj.th a chimney sweep! The best thing of all, however, \nis the suggestion that.t:Jhe officia,l editor is afraid to notice \nus, as if he did, ·we might give him a nickname! Picture \na ma,n going into Irish. pwblic life weighed down with \na morbid dread that some one wo uld give •him a nick­\nname 1. Pictm·e the official editor bei,ng offered a brief \nin the Courts. We see him in om: mind's eye w eighing \nup the probwbilities of being called a nickname by the \nopposing counsel; if Tim Hea .ly were ou !Jhe other side, \nhe might consider the risk too great, a.nd might decline \nthe brief. Now if tlhe ·official editor is really in dread of \na nicknam e, he has no reaso·n to be thankful to this \nMr. Morris for lett.iug :bhe, cat out of the bag; for it is \nrumost like offering a. prize to the country for the best. \nnickname for the official editor. \nHere is a grave -indictment from this Mr . Morris:­\n\"Are .not the editorial columns of the LEADER master­\npieces of vituperation 1 Is there a single Irish paper \nhas invented a.nd used morn nick,names durino-the \nfour and a half yea.rs of its existence than the L~ADER \nhas done? Why it would fill coh1mns of ,t.his paper if we \nmade a. compilation of all il1e nickna.mes the LEADE R \nhas ,invented and made use of.\" Well, we certainly wilt \nmake a. clean breast of it, and admit that we did invent \nsome JJicknam es in our time. We believe it was we \nwho nicknamed a certn.in portion of -Lliis nation \"Irish \nIreland.\" We certainly have it on om· conscience tihat \nwe invented \"Sourfaoe\" and \"Saved\"; we first nicknamed \nbhe publicn,ns of this country \"Bung ,\" and c.'\\.lled a type \nof manufactm·ers \"Dark Bro!Jhers.\" We nicknamed n, \noortn.i:n cla.ss of writing-perhaps this Mr. Morris is \ngetting fidgety here-we nicknamed a, certn.in class of \nwriting ''ra:imeis\"--01h, no doubt about it, we have been \ngrea.t sinners ,iin the nicknaming ,line and no mistake .. \nAnd the ,rorst of it is tilrn.t the nickmwn es we ·have in­\nvented so· far are, we trust, nothing to those tha.t ,ve \nhope we will be, inspire-cl to iinvent as Ume goes on. \nA fair indication of the calibre and bra,i,ns and level­\nheadedness of this co1'1--espondent of om· Dunda.Jlc con­\ntemporary who is .a, member of the Executive of the \nGaelfo League, may be judged by one pa,rticula.rly bright; \nsuggestJion. He is talking of \"some friends,\" whoever \nthey ma.y be, of 1:Jhe LEADER, and he says :-\"Sinoe \ntihen tbe®e have avowed the intoution, a.ncl appa.reutly­\n·still oherish the· idea, of destroying the Claidheami1, \nSol-it.is .and m aki-t1g tlbe LEADER the mouthpiece o.f the \nGaelic Len,gue. lile.nce those atta,cks on the officinI \norga.n, ostensil>ly i,n U1e interests of the public.\" Of \ncom-se ·this ·twaddle need only ho pr.inted to be pro;vecI \nn,?sur~ ;_ hut beyond its inhereint .absUl'dity; it shows a \nd1spos1t10on to see ''plots\" .and \"sohemes\" auid such like, \na disposition, u,nhappily, too prevalenb in this half-slave,. \na,nd over-suspicious coutrtry, and wihich causes a, lot of \navoicln.ble mischief.

Egerton, t•he· imported \n,Secretary at tlie G.P.O., Dublin, has now-happi.ly for \nIrish IreJ.a.nd'--undismaye.cl by 1:Jhe. fate of Hoi:,atius of \nRiverstown, stepped into the· breach ,a,t, the G.P.O ., \nDublin. He h·as struck the, pole of combat outside the \ndoor of Irish Ireland. Poor Mr. Egerton, who bei,ng a \nBritisher, does not know this country, has done the \nright thing-from the Irish Irela,nd point of view I The \nwar with t,he anti-Irish post office needed no!Jhing so \nmuch as t;h.is tiime.ly interfere.nee o.f t,he G.P.O., Du!bl,in. \nHundreds of parce·ls addressed in, Irish from the head· \nqua.rters Qf the Gaelic League were turned a.way from \nt,he doors; thousa,nds of pa.reels a.nd l~tters will, of \neour.se, be the reply back straiglit ,between the eyes of \nMr. Egerton, t,be imported Secretary of the G.P.O., \nDubJ.in. Perhaps Mir. Egerton is only a factotum, and \n·may be only carrying out the instructions of his British \nmasters; but ~ mention his name .as !he is the Secre­\ntary of the G.P.O. a,nd .a B1itish imporlation like the \nEditor of -the Dust Bin. A tableau of the anti-Irish \npost office represe,nting Horatius of Riverstown in the \ndust and Egerton, the B1iitisher, of Dublin, making a \nlast staud for Englishism in the Post Office service of \nt..his country, wo -uJcl be :a welcome feature o.f next Su·il­\nday's procession. \nAgain, as Fa.ther Brennan, of Killarney, a, frontrra.nk \nma -n in Irish Ireland, suggests, the Language Wook \nshould ma.rk a special assa.ult on the anti-Irish Post \nOffice Give, it to them hot. E .ven though a few \nthousa.nd unnecessary stamps were bought from the \nB1-:itish Government, the money would be w'ell expended \nif it made . a stir in the Post Office service; it would \nhelp to ra.m the Post Office's anti-Irish spite down its \nown throat. \nNow bha.t St. Pat1-:ick's Day is a. re<:ognised holiday, \na.ncl the aotion of his Grace the Ai·chbishop in conjuuc­\ntio,n with the other forces workiug that way has probaibly \nknocked the ground from under the feet of the licensed \nspongers 011 St. Pa.trick in Dublin, it would be a good \nthing if ,a, leading note in the grea.t la.nguage procession \n--we hope the greatest that was ever seen in the stree.ts \nof Dublin-were a note of defiant reply to· the a,uti.­\nIrish action of the anti-Irish Post Office autho1J.-:ities. \nIrishmen a,re specially good 11.t fighting aga.·inst 11, tangible \nobjective; EgerLon, the imported Se<:reta:ry of the \nG .P.O ., Dubli-n, has supplied a seasona.ble \"Aunt Sally\" \nfor the wits of the Langua.ge Processio-n, a,nd it would \nbe 11, pity not to avail of the sport. The Language Pro­\ncession in Dublin is the an.nual ti-:iumpha.I march of Irish \nIrela.nd in the metropolis. The heart of it beats wibh \nthe determined thitd of a tra,11&-AtlanUc liner's engine, \nbut· it has·, and wisely, its lighter· and humorous side!, \nalso. The .anti-Irish Poot Office offers good treatment \nfor those who are looking ,after the lighter side as well \nit.s fo1, those whose teeth are set in the ca.use.

Mr. P . T. Daly, T.C., should pro­\nceed at once to London, accompanied by Mr. A. J. \nNicolls, of Dublin Castle The Irish Language Cause is \nsurely being undermined by this foul organ of the London \nGaelic League! We are only playing second fiddle in \ntreacherous iniquity to Ini.'Jfa•il. \nThe ,re ,bas been quite a controve•rsy in tJhe Dmidalk \nDemocrat about the LEADER; it .a,rose out of the anony­\nmous fulminations written by a Nrr. H enry Morris, who \nis also a member of the Executive of the Gaelic League. \n\\Ve note that this Mr . Henry Morr.is, writing as ''we\" in \nour l!Jundalk contemporary, lets fly to tho extent of \na.bout two colUJlilns, :i.n the issue of February 25th, by \nwa ,y of reply to two· lette,rs tlw:t ha.cl appea,red in a pre­\nvious issue of that paper. It is no-ne of our busi,ness to \nintrnd~ very muchi in the, controversy going on in \na.uother paper, but there are a few tlii.ngs i,n the two \ncolumns of notes to wbioh we have refer,recl that amused \nus, and which may also amuse our readers. The w1·iter \nof the notes, as we ,have said, is a. membe ,r of the E .xecu­\n.t,ive, and, tberefo-re knows something of the inner \nwol'king. He evidenbly knows why the mighty official \norgan, that cost the:• Language Fund £1,091 fo reoonb \nyears, turns up ite ·haughty nose at us; what is more, \nhe has bltwted out his knowledge .

So we are Loo \"vulgar\" and \"scurrilous\" to• \nbe spoken to by the highly respectx1,ble and ve,ry \":tony\" \nofficia.J editor! And bhe writer o.f the notes in our \nDundalk oonte.mporary, who is shocked .at our \"scur­\nrility,\" couples us neatly, as· it will have been observed, \nwj.th a chimney sweep! The best thing of all, however, \nis the suggestion that.t:Jhe officia,l editor is afraid to notice \nus, as if he did, ·we might give him a nickname! Picture \na ma,n going into Irish. pwblic life weighed down with \na morbid dread that some one wo uld give •him a nick­\nname 1. Pictm·e the official editor bei,ng offered a brief \nin the Courts. We see him in om: mind's eye w eighing \nup the probwbilities of being called a nickname by the \nopposing counsel; if Tim Hea .ly were ou !Jhe other side, \nhe might consider the risk too great, a.nd might decline \nthe brief. Now if tlhe ·official editor is really in dread of \na nicknam e, he has no reaso·n to be thankful to this \nMr. Morris for lett.iug :bhe, cat out of the bag; for it is \nrumost like offering a. prize to the country for the best. \nnickname for the official editor. \nHere is a grave -indictment from this Mr . Morris:­\n\"Are .not the editorial columns of the LEADER master­\npieces of vituperation 1 Is there a single Irish paper \nhas invented a.nd used morn nick,names durino-the \nfour and a half yea.rs of its existence than the L~ADER \nhas done? Why it would fill coh1mns of ,t.his paper if we \nmade a. compilation of all il1e nickna.mes the LEADE R \nhas ,invented and made use of.\" Well, we certainly wilt \nmake a. clean breast of it, and admit that we did invent \nsome JJicknam es in our time. We believe it was we \nwho nicknamed a certn.in portion of -Lliis nation \"Irish \nIreland.\" We certainly have it on om· conscience tihat \nwe invented \"Sourfaoe\" and \"Saved\"; we first nicknamed \nbhe publicn,ns of this country \"Bung ,\" and c.'\\.lled a type \nof manufactm·ers \"Dark Bro!Jhers.\" We nicknamed n, \noortn.i:n cla.ss of writing-perhaps this Mr. Morris is \ngetting fidgety here-we nicknamed a, certn.in class of \nwriting ''ra:imeis\"--01h, no doubt about it, we have been \ngrea.t sinners ,iin the nicknaming ,line and no mistake .. \nAnd the ,rorst of it is tilrn.t the nickmwn es we ·have in­\nvented so· far are, we trust, nothing to those tha.t ,ve \nhope we will be, inspire-cl to iinvent as Ume goes on. \nA fair indication of the calibre and bra,i,ns and level­\nheadedness of this co1'1--espondent of om· Dunda.Jlc con­\ntemporary who is .a, member of the Executive of the \nGaelfo League, may be judged by one pa,rticula.rly bright; \nsuggestJion. He is talking of \"some friends,\" whoever \nthey ma.y be, of 1:Jhe LEADER, and he says :-\"Sinoe \ntihen tbe®e have avowed the intoution, a.ncl appa.reutly­\n·still oherish the· idea, of destroying the Claidheami1, \nSol-it.is .and m aki-t1g tlbe LEADER the mouthpiece o.f the \nGaelic Len,gue. lile.nce those atta,cks on the officinI \norga.n, ostensil>ly i,n U1e interests of the public.\" Of \ncom-se ·this ·twaddle need only ho pr.inted to be pro;vecI \nn,?sur~ ;_ hut beyond its inhereint .absUl'dity; it shows a \nd1spos1t10on to see ''plots\" .and \"sohemes\" auid such like, \na disposition, u,nhappily, too prevalenb in this half-slave,. \na,nd over-suspicious coutrtry, and wihich causes a, lot of \navoicln.ble mischief.

As far as we could judge, they all appea.red to be \n-€Xcellently turned out, a,nd each shirt, is marked with the \nna.me of the factory. We welcome this rising Limerick \n:industry.

To say that the book is \nnot free from defects, is on.ly to say that it is not a;. \nmiracle--a foolishly superfluous piece of information, \nwhich, .how ever, might as well be 1nca.nt as a slur, for the \nda.mp er it is fitted to cast on many who , from old fami­\nliarity with disa,ppointm ent in t,hat m at.tor, are but toe, \na,pt to despair of ever seeing a good Irish dictiona.ry. \nViewed in itself, the book has, to be sure, defects, and, \ninde-ed, full man y of them; bu t tha,t is for a reason for \nwhich Father Dinn een w as in no wise accouuta,ble, for \nt-he reason, that is, that great number s of defects were \nsimply inevitable in the circumstances. But taking the \nw ork a,s F ather Dinn een hact to ta.ke it, in its enormou s \nand unspea.ka,ble difficulties-the only point of view from \nwhich it is pos,ible to he just to it---it. has no defects, for \nit rises .high .above the level of perfection- any perfection \nwhich could have been rationally looked for. It is a, \ndelightful book simply as it stands, \\\\'ere it never-pu'O \nn,\\11 Le151u '01,1-to be improved a jot. \\.Vhcre does it \nlaud us·, in cornpa,rison ,vii-th where w e were but yester­\nday? Why, quite .a half-century in advance. Were all the \nmod ern Irish vocabula,·ics, save itself, to be swept out of \nexistence to-morrow, itself would fa.r more than supply \ntheir place, with bhe addit.ional advai1tage of being one \nbook, not a, score, or a hundred,.

I propose \nto consider chiefly religious communities of wom en ; \nbecause, though c1iitics assume the task of critic\\sing \nbhem ati will, they cannot defend them selves; bC;51~es, \nI will have something to say later on about rehgious \ncommunities of men . \nNuns do various works. Some are engaged in mu ·s. \ning; a.nd of these some undertake p1,ivate nursing, a.nd \nsome underLa.ke the work in public institutions.

If a few young ladies join in est,ab!ishing -n, \npnva.te hospital or a private. school, -they acquire no \nclaim .to public support unless in so far as they eam \nit, and if they were to form themselves into i~ per­\nmanentJ community ,by making reLigious vows under t~e \nsanction of Ecclesiasticn,l authority, no supera<lclecl claim \nu-pon the public would come with their vows and change \nof life.

Some are engaged in mu ·s. \ning; a.nd of these some undertake p1,ivate nursing, a.nd \nsome underLa.ke the work in public institutions.

If a few young ladies join in est,ab!ishing -n, \npnva.te hospital or a private. school, -they acquire no \nclaim .to public support unless in so far as they eam \nit, and if they were to form themselves into i~ per­\nmanentJ community ,by making reLigious vows under t~e \nsanction of Ecclesiasticn,l authority, no supera<lclecl claim \nu-pon the public would come with their vows and change \nof life.

Our view that \n·the King should be addressed honestly when ho comes \n·hero, that he should be told our grievances, and if he \n,did not like to hear -honest ta.lk, that ho could do the \n-other thing, is a, live policy-a policy meeting the living \n:situation.

We stand for living \nreality; they fall back, or pretend to do so, on unreal \niPOse. Sta.nding on 1783 might have been real enough \n100 years ago, but a century of acquiescence is a long \ntime; and it is incumbent on others besides blacksmiths \nto strike the iron while it is hot.

I now make bold to bring \nunder your notice anotl1er type of Catl1olic. \nIn the Irish 'l.'imes, of January 9th, a manifesto a.p­\npea,red from a, number of Irish Ca.tholic laymen, on Uni­\nversity reform in Ireland.

I only want to point out what krn;cl \nof m ettle there is in Mr. Charles E. M artin and Ins \nfriends, judging from their manifesto. \nTh e ma ,nifesto is writ~n to point ont the inconsistency \nof tho£e w ho opposed the plan of Univ ersity settlement \nwhich they proposed in 1902. That opposition, they \nsa,y, arose from \" the belief that it w ould _put an end to \na-11 existing lay control over the high.er brnnches of educa.­\ntion of la,y C atholics, a.ncl substitute for it a practically \nabsolute clerical control.\" In reply they say that not \nthey, the mal'lifesto writers, but thm :e w ho opposed their \nplan, help to retain clerica.l control. F or, tl:ey say, there \ni, no cafo of _substituting clc,rica.J for la,y coutw l, since \nclericn,l control is the ad ual order of the clay; but they \nm y that we propored our plan, to do a,w ay w ith that; be­\ncause, given t,he pla.n we proposed, w e w ill crea-te a body \nof lay tea.cl1ers w ho will put a.n encl to clerical control in \nIrish Ca,tholic education ; but, things remaiuing as they \nare, clerica.l control will stay as it exists now, absolute \na-ncl ubiquitous. \nI think they w ould comm a,ud m ore respect with those \nw hom they seek to propitia-te if they &]Jent the time they_ \nwaste on this rlure \" blru·ney \" O ll fighting their rights \non independent Ca tholic gJ·ounds. N ot one, I ca.n hardly \nthink, of those wh om tJ1ey W aJlt to propitia.te will be­\nEeve in the alleged purpose of their pla,n or their rnani­\nf.esto. If I were of those opponents wh om they seek to \nconvince, this is how I wo uld thiuk of their m a.uifesto :­\nTh ose gentlem en cannot be trusted ; w hy, they seem t.o \nhave no principle at a,ll; they a.re neither with us, nor \narc they with tf1eir own ; they are P apists a.t heru·t, but \nthey wa nt to conceal it. And this is the reason I wo uld \ngive myself; because their ma nifesto is not true to the \nprinciples they should as C atholics hold; it is not true \neven to itself. • \nT hey say \" we ru·e strongly opposed to the secula~-isa,tion \nof schools.\" Th en they refer to their plaJ1 of settlem ent, \nand they say of it-\" It did not suggest a, Catholic Uni­\nYe rsity; it did not suggest a denomin a,tional Co llege, un­\n•less T rinity C oUege ca.n be called denomina tional, a chaJ·­\nacter w hich its clef.enders repudiate. It sough t to acid \nanother C ollege to the University of Dublin, hut this \nCo llege wa s to be a,bsolutely free from tests-Ca,tholics \na.nd nou-Oatholics were alike to be admissible to it-s \nstudies, honours, and administra.tion. The clergy w ere \nt1J have no representation de jnre on the governing body, \nand such representa,tion as they might have de /acto w as \nto be strictly limited.\" And they add tha.t this pla,n \n\"ought at least to have beeu free from the charge of \nbeing calculated to consofidate or increase clerical control \nover ecluca.tion.\" Indeed, yes; it would be strauge to \nm ake such a cha,rge against such a plan. But do these \nmen think that those whom they wish to propitiate w11l \nbelieve that their decla.ration is more tha11 \" blarney,\" if \nthey write as Ca.tholics. Th eir plan is :-A Colleo-e \ncoupled with Ti-inity College under the Univ ersity ~f \nDublin·. Those who control that as Lo teaching and ad­\nministration, as wed! as those who make their studies in \n·it, might be Catholics, Protestants, infidels, \" Turks \nJews, or Atheists\"--aJ.l will have equal rights and a.1~ \nequa,l run there.

There is a. total absence of any a.ttempt at grouprng \nsynonyms. This is a very great disadva;uta,ge, but, of \ncourse, I am quite alive to the am oun t of tune and labour \nit would have dem anded. For pmpose s of reference a.ncl \nconsnlta.tion., however , it must .a.lways stand as·· a, vita.I \nfea.ture of a lexicon a.nd it is surely to be hoped tlia.t \nJ!'ather Dinneen wili yet find time nnd oppo~·tunity to \nturn some of his attention to it-the rntber, rncleed, as \nIrish is 1• language a.bounding_ in ~y~1011ym s and synony_m­\nous phrases, never a one of which 1s idle, but fraught W1th \nits own sha.de of force and purport. . \n2. In gro.uping variants i_mcler a word , _mstea,d_ ofpu_~ \nting them in the column, m the wonte~ way, m theu \na-lpha.betical order, he makes _the book hable to be ~et \nclown as not having those va.nants at a.JI, whereas they \n;ire there, but not out in the column, as they •had better \nbe. In-fact I kno•w of cases where he hns been accused \nof not, having the word at all, a.ncl where I afterwards \nfound-but only through the accid~nt of close and ~!most \nexhaustive perusal-that he had it, but not out m bhe \nF RED LEWIS and 00.'S PERFUMES AND TOI­\nLET REQUISITES; IRISH MANUF AOTUR:I \ncolumn, in its alphabetical place. '.Dhis happens too, \nsometimes, when it is not a variant (and therefore has \nnot even the chance of being a.lphabotica.lly close to its \nco-va,ria.nt), but a synonym . \n3. There .aa·e some words absent, whose absence it is \nnot easy to account for, as they are to be found in books \nwhich Father Dinneen must .have read, a.nd even in com­\npiled voca.bularies which it is clear he has consulted. \n4. Th ere are some words wh ich, though having plain, \nfamiliar meaning s, a,re themselves not familiar, and to \nwhich, nevertheless, no context is supplied which might \n·give security for t:Jhefr genuineness. '.Dhis, no doubt, is \nfor w a.ut of space as well as of time, a.ud we m ay, forcer­\ntain, bop e it will la,ter 011 be rem edied; but, in the mean­\ntime, it will forbid any wise writer to feel justified in \nma.Jciug any use of such words,. let them in reality be \nneveir so genuine. \n5. In common with .a.II the editors tha.t have edited \na.nythiug Irish since Dr. Atkinson's edition of the Cpi \nb1opi:;,,01te .111 l'.M 1r appeared, F,ather Dinn een has an \nevident tendency to adopt Dr. Atkinson's trea.tment of \nany given word, without quesbion . This is very a,bstu·cl, \nas I ha.ve had occasion, once upon a time, to prove pub­\nlicly. Within the 500• pages, or thereabouts, of tha.t \nbook, I am certa.in I could bring hom e 500 errors to, the \ndoctor, nea,rly a.JI of them e,i·rors a.1ising out of unac­\nquaintance with the spoken language, a,nd out of conse­\nquent.-inevita.bly consequeht.-wa.nt of insight into a. \ndifficulty turning up, here or thel·e, in the liternture. \nSuch a.n editor is, of course, au a,bsurdly unsa,fe guid:e, \nespecially for a, lexicographer of the modern language, to \nfollow without unJ!a.gging caution, a.ncl I a.m just a. little \nsurprised at F ather Dinneeu's seeming not to have seen \nthis, or not to have kept it steadily in view. I have \nnot time, a.nd there is not very mu ch need, to give here \nmor e than one iusta.n·ce of wha ,t I mean.

Th e genuine \nm eaning of n1e.,rc,,l is---to minister to; to attend to; \nto be in w a,iting on, in a.tteudance on; to look to; to be \nin presence and reacli~ess to a. given need, or occasion; \nin a word, to ,attend to-anything, i_u any w a.y.

In gro.uping variants i_mcler a word , _mstea,d_ ofpu_~ \nting them in the column, m the wonte~ way, m theu \na-lpha.betical order, he makes _the book hable to be ~et \nclown as not having those va.nants at a.JI, whereas they \n;ire there, but not out in the column, as they •had better \nbe.

'.Dhis happens too, \nsometimes, when it is not a variant (and therefore has \nnot even the chance of being a.lphabotica.lly close to its \nco-va,ria.nt), but a synonym . \n3. There .aa·e some words absent, whose absence it is \nnot easy to account for, as they are to be found in books \nwhich Father Dinneen must .have read, a.nd even in com­\npiled voca.bularies which it is clear he has consulted. \n4. Th ere are some words wh ich, though having plain, \nfamiliar meaning s, a,re themselves not familiar, and to \nwhich, nevertheless, no context is supplied which might \n·give security for t:Jhefr genuineness. '.Dhis, no doubt, is \nfor w a.ut of space as well as of time, a.ud we m ay, forcer­\ntain, bop e it will la,ter 011 be rem edied; but, in the mean­\ntime, it will forbid any wise writer to feel justified in \nma.Jciug any use of such words,. let them in reality be \nneveir so genuine. \n5.

This is very a,bstu·cl, \nas I ha.ve had occasion, once upon a time, to prove pub­\nlicly. Within the 500• pages, or thereabouts, of tha.t \nbook, I am certa.in I could bring hom e 500 errors to, the \ndoctor, nea,rly a.JI of them e,i·rors a.1ising out of unac­\nquaintance with the spoken language, a,nd out of conse­\nquent.-inevita.bly consequeht.-wa.nt of insight into a. \ndifficulty turning up, here or thel·e, in the liternture. \nSuch a.n editor is, of course, au a,bsurdly unsa,fe guid:e, \nespecially for a, lexicographer of the modern language, to \nfollow without unJ!a.gging caution, a.ncl I a.m just a. little \nsurprised at F ather Dinneeu's seeming not to have seen \nthis, or not to have kept it steadily in view. I have \nnot time, a.nd there is not very mu ch need, to give here \nmor e than one iusta.n·ce of wha ,t I mean.

I luwe seen some demurrings in a \\Vestem \npapei·, to som e omissions of words alleged to have been \nsent on to F.a,tuier Dinn een. The se complaints m ay, of \ncourse, be just enough , in t,he sense tha,t what is com ­\nplained of ma.y be a fact; but they are ,ha,rdly generous, \nnot ,only, er not to sa,y, to the editor, but even-to the \nWest-. It, is not a.t a.11 generous, for it is highly unjust to \nthe \\,Vest,, to sa,y •that wh.ich., though, perhaps true enough \nin iwe_lf, is unnecessary to be said for the discerning, who \n\"·ill see it for themselves, a.nd which ca.n do no good, but \n,·ery likely haJ·m to the rest; which is fitted to give the \nmultitude the very little grounds t,ha-t are alwa.ys a.mply \n_sufficient for it to found its false impression on, to its \now.n loss; the false impression apt to arise in the present \ninstance being that F ather Diun een's dicl,iona,ry mu st be \nw holly worthless to a. Western , and so not to be bought,, \nand so a most grievous· delusion and loss to the Western, \nand this on the absurdly ina.dequa.te ground tha.t some \nCo nnacht words a.re actually absent from the column s of \nwhat is-, in reality, a. huge cllct,iona.ry. F or m y own part, \nI simply cannot look a,t the book in the light of w ha.t. is \nnot in it, I a.m so astonis-hed a.t a.JI that ,;.,. T'l1e book \nseems sma ,11, because the print, though com forta.bly clea.r \nand lemble, is sma .11 enough to allow ~ grea.t <lea,! of \nm atter° to fit in a compass which print a, little· la1·ge1· \nw ould make into ~ book three times the size, a.nd ten \ntimes the imposingness and show of imp ortance. Bu t \nii anyon e regards the dictiona,ry, as it stands, as a. dimi­\nnutive piece of work , let him turn to run clown one of \nthe letter,;--say, S - in its column s; a.nd be he never so \nlabori0us a student, if he finishes the letter a.tone sitt.iug, \nlmving well considered of every word , I'll guarantee, tha,t \nhe will find himself ra.ther disposed to consult the fresh \nair. \nComing to the book in itself, I make bold to think \nsome su.,.gestions mi.,.ht be offered w ith a, view to future \neditions~ Out of ma0ny others·, I would call a,ttention for \nthe present to these few following points: - . \n1. There is a. total absence of any a.ttempt at grouprng \nsynonyms. This is a very great disadva;uta,ge, but, of \ncourse, I am quite alive to the am oun t of tune and labour \nit would have dem anded. For pmpose s of reference a.ncl \nconsnlta.tion., however , it must .a.lways stand as·· a, vita.I \nfea.ture of a lexicon a.nd it is surely to be hoped tlia.t \nJ!'ather Dinneen wili yet find time nnd oppo~·tunity to \nturn some of his attention to it-the rntber, rncleed, as \nIrish is 1• language a.bounding_ in ~y~1011ym s and synony_m­\nous phrases, never a one of which 1s idle, but fraught W1th \nits own sha.de of force and purport. . \n2. In gro.uping variants i_mcler a word , _mstea,d_ ofpu_~ \nting them in the column, m the wonte~ way, m theu \na-lpha.betical order, he makes _the book hable to be ~et \nclown as not having those va.nants at a.JI, whereas they \n;ire there, but not out in the column, as they •had better \nbe. In-fact I kno•w of cases where he hns been accused \nof not, having the word at all, a.ncl where I afterwards \nfound-but only through the accid~nt of close and ~!most \nexhaustive perusal-that he had it, but not out m bhe \nF RED LEWIS and 00.'S PERFUMES AND TOI­\nLET REQUISITES; IRISH MANUF AOTUR:I \ncolumn, in its alphabetical place. '.Dhis happens too, \nsometimes, when it is not a variant (and therefore has \nnot even the chance of being a.lphabotica.lly close to its \nco-va,ria.nt), but a synonym . \n3. There .aa·e some words absent, whose absence it is \nnot easy to account for, as they are to be found in books \nwhich Father Dinneen must .have read, a.nd even in com­\npiled voca.bularies which it is clear he has consulted. \n4. Th ere are some words wh ich, though having plain, \nfamiliar meaning s, a,re themselves not familiar, and to \nwhich, nevertheless, no context is supplied which might \n·give security for t:Jhefr genuineness. '.Dhis, no doubt, is \nfor w a.ut of space as well as of time, a.ud we m ay, forcer­\ntain, bop e it will la,ter 011 be rem edied; but, in the mean­\ntime, it will forbid any wise writer to feel justified in \nma.Jciug any use of such words,. let them in reality be \nneveir so genuine. \n5. In common with .a.II the editors tha.t have edited \na.nythiug Irish since Dr. Atkinson's edition of the Cpi \nb1opi:;,,01te .111 l'.M 1r appeared, F,ather Dinn een has an \nevident tendency to adopt Dr. Atkinson's trea.tment of \nany given word, without quesbion . This is very a,bstu·cl, \nas I ha.ve had occasion, once upon a time, to prove pub­\nlicly. Within the 500• pages, or thereabouts, of tha.t \nbook, I am certa.in I could bring hom e 500 errors to, the \ndoctor, nea,rly a.JI of them e,i·rors a.1ising out of unac­\nquaintance with the spoken language, a,nd out of conse­\nquent.-inevita.bly consequeht.-wa.nt of insight into a. \ndifficulty turning up, here or thel·e, in the liternture. \nSuch a.n editor is, of course, au a,bsurdly unsa,fe guid:e, \nespecially for a, lexicographer of the modern language, to \nfollow without unJ!a.gging caution, a.ncl I a.m just a. little \nsurprised at F ather Dinneeu's seeming not to have seen \nthis, or not to have kept it steadily in view. I have \nnot time, a.nd there is not very mu ch need, to give here \nmor e than one iusta.n·ce of wha ,t I mean.

I only want to point out what krn;cl \nof m ettle there is in Mr. Charles E. M artin and Ins \nfriends, judging from their manifesto. \nTh e ma ,nifesto is writ~n to point ont the inconsistency \nof tho£e w ho opposed the plan of Univ ersity settlement \nwhich they proposed in 1902. That opposition, they \nsa,y, arose from \" the belief that it w ould _put an end to \na-11 existing lay control over the high.er brnnches of educa.­\ntion of la,y C atholics, a.ncl substitute for it a practically \nabsolute clerical control.\" In reply they say that not \nthey, the mal'lifesto writers, but thm :e w ho opposed their \nplan, help to retain clerica.l control. F or, tl:ey say, there \ni, no cafo of _substituting clc,rica.J for la,y coutw l, since \nclericn,l control is the ad ual order of the clay; but they \nm y that we propored our plan, to do a,w ay w ith that; be­\ncause, given t,he pla.n we proposed, w e w ill crea-te a body \nof lay tea.cl1ers w ho will put a.n encl to clerical control in \nIrish Ca,tholic education ; but, things remaiuing as they \nare, clerica.l control will stay as it exists now, absolute \na-ncl ubiquitous. \nI think they w ould comm a,ud m ore respect with those \nw hom they seek to propitia-te if they &]Jent the time they_ \nwaste on this rlure \" blru·ney \" O ll fighting their rights \non independent Ca tholic gJ·ounds. N ot one, I ca.n hardly \nthink, of those wh om tJ1ey W aJlt to propitia.te will be­\nEeve in the alleged purpose of their pla,n or their rnani­\nf.esto. If I were of those opponents wh om they seek to \nconvince, this is how I wo uld thiuk of their m a.uifesto :­\nTh ose gentlem en cannot be trusted ; w hy, they seem t.o \nhave no principle at a,ll; they a.re neither with us, nor \narc they with tf1eir own ; they are P apists a.t heru·t, but \nthey wa nt to conceal it.

The faithful are the stones; ,vhosoever undertakes \npainful labour from brotherly love bears up the storits placed above \nhim.

A tableau of the anti-Irish \npost office represe,nting Horatius of Riverstown in the \ndust and Egerton, the B1iitisher, of Dublin, making a \nlast staud for Englishism in the Post Office service of \nt..his country, wo -uJcl be :a welcome feature o.f next Su·il­\nday's procession. \nAgain, as Fa.ther Brennan, of Killarney, a, frontrra.nk \nma -n in Irish Ireland, suggests, the Language Wook \nshould ma.rk a special assa.ult on the anti-Irish Post \nOffice Give, it to them hot. E .ven though a few \nthousa.nd unnecessary stamps were bought from the \nB1-:itish Government, the money would be w'ell expended \nif it made . a stir in the Post Office service; it would \nhelp to ra.m the Post Office's anti-Irish spite down its \nown throat. \nNow bha.t St. Pat1-:ick's Day is a. re<:ognised holiday, \na.ncl the aotion of his Grace the Ai·chbishop in conjuuc­\ntio,n with the other forces workiug that way has probaibly \nknocked the ground from under the feet of the licensed \nspongers 011 St. Pa.trick in Dublin, it would be a good \nthing if ,a, leading note in the grea.t la.nguage procession \n--we hope the greatest that was ever seen in the stree.ts \nof Dublin-were a note of defiant reply to· the a,uti.­\nIrish action of the anti-Irish Post Office autho1J.-:ities. \nIrishmen a,re specially good 11.t fighting aga.·inst 11, tangible \nobjective; EgerLon, the imported Se<:reta:ry of the \nG .P.O ., Dubli-n, has supplied a seasona.ble \"Aunt Sally\" \nfor the wits of the Langua.ge Processio-n, a,nd it would \nbe 11, pity not to avail of the sport. The Language Pro­\ncession in Dublin is the an.nual ti-:iumpha.I march of Irish \nIrela.nd in the metropolis. The heart of it beats wibh \nthe determined thitd of a tra,11&-AtlanUc liner's engine, \nbut· it has·, and wisely, its lighter· and humorous side!, \nalso. The .anti-Irish Poot Office offers good treatment \nfor those who are looking ,after the lighter side as well \nit.s fo1, those whose teeth are set in the ca.use. Down \nwith the anti-I1-:ish Post Office by .all means; but it \nwould be .also .a, healthy a,nd a wholesome thing to make \nDublin laugh .at iit. Egerton, from .Britain, mig:ht as \nweU attempt to, drain the Atlantic with a,n imported \nB1-:itish sorver's hrut, as stop the full tide of Irish. Irela.ud; \n.a,nd he ought to be told so, and · well told so, d111-:iug \nLa.ngua,ge Week . \nThe following occurs in the Lenten Pastoral of his \nEminence Cardina.l Logue:-\" It is to be fen.red that \nnewspapers, indiscreetly conducted, contribute la.ri;,ely to \nthe mischief. It is <;erta,in that, with very few e-:zcep­\ntions, they encoura.ge, propagate, and mainta.in the gam­\nbling spirit among the people; but for this they claim a. \nkind of clrn.rtered right.\" Almost, needless to say, th<:, \nha'penny lndepemlent climbed the Pastora,l kopje on \nMonday. However, in view of ,the engagemeut of the \nBritish lady tipster it had to pick its steps ca.refully so \nt'ha.t it would .not bark its shins .i.gainst this sharp \nboulder; so, as might be expected, there is not a, word in \nthe Independent article concerning his Eminence's refer­\nen~ to the part that newspapers play'. in pandering to \nand sl.i.mulati•ng the awful betting evil that .afflicts this \npoo.r la.nd.

Previous to tihat time the Postmaster Genera.I \n• v,nd the \" Saved\" st-a.ffs of the Secretary's a,nd Surveyor's \nOffices could do what they liked with the Post Office in \nIreland. Postmasters, Engineers, Superintendents, etc., \narrived into this country as regula.r a.nd as numerous as \n\"the mails,\" and nobody seemed to ca.re much how or \nwhy it all happened. To say the least, the poor sub­\nservient hish had no st-rength or independence o.f spirit. \nThey' treated themselves more· or less ,a,s an infer.for class \nand seemed to be very well satisfied ·that they existed \nat all. In this respect lihey differed in ·no way from the \ngenerality of Ii-:is-hmen. It is only a case in point which \nclearly indicates those: s]a.vish a,nd inert cha.r.a-0teiistics \nwhich had gl'Ow.n into us. \nWith • the establishment of an Irish Association, the \nIrish at last began to wake up and to question -tJhese im­\nportations, and many other things which English Asso­\ncia.tions with ''dead and alive\" Irish branches never \ntroubled aboub. It is a good thiug ·this first sign of re­\nturning oonsci-ausness, and as t;he Irish ha.ve now fairly \nstarted on . the r-0a.d towards agita,tion on their own a.c­\ncoun•t, the foHowing short review of the situa.tion will \nperhaps be in seasonable time : -\nRegarding tJhe ag-itation for increase of pay a,nd con­\nditions of work, I sha.11 say nothing, as these questions \nchiefly concern the Postmaster-General and the Sta.ff. \nI will howeve:r, rema.rk that the deferred, pay system\" \nis the' most hollow mockery ever devised. It is briefly \nthis:-ThatJ out of an officer's pay there is stopped, \nweekly, a oorta.in percentage which, on ~-eti:°ment, fo.~ms \nhis pension allowance. If the person dies m the service, \nf,he accumula.ted· deferred pa.y is not given to his wife \nGUNB FISHING TAOKLE, J'lne■ t qallt,,, ohapett In tho XlngdoJ11.. \nBeat T\n0\nront Flfea, Irf•h Tied, 1/4 per do■.

It is in fMJt a mere m-oney-mabng device of \nau ingenious kind and the Postmaster-General knows \nLhat well, a,nd at the back ·of the pretended benevolence \nof a good Gove1,nment, there a.re, I expect, many mathe­\nma.tical financial ca.lcula.tions which. a lot of people a.re \nentirely unsuspicious of. . . \nAboub the promotions.-This is SOIJilething thati wiJl \ninterest the public, and wi'II a,lso be beneficial to those \nw,ho aro agii'tati-ng by w:a.y of opening their eyes to some­\nthing which they may perhaps be not a.ware of. In the \npast tihe Irish were treated as nothing. At tJhe present \nthe Postmaster-General has becoone i.n a small way \nreasonable. The,re are mainy conditions which. milita.te \n,igai11st Ir•ishmen, and I wi.JI endea.vour to enumerate a \nfew and to explain them : -\n(1). The spirit of serfdom and indifference which dis­\ntinguished the olde1, generation does still exercise a \ndepressing i.nfluence over tJhe younger men. 'Dhere is \na tendency, with them, to fall i-nto the old groove, and \nex.ample a.nd smToundings ·help to keep them in it. The \nresulb -is tha.t they also become careless and i,ndifferent \nas to, the futm·e, amd • neglect to t-ake a wholesome in­\nterest i-n the business, and when a man loses interest in \nhimself there is no hope for him. \n(2). The great majority of the superior positions being \nin ·the bands of the .anti-Irish, there is little encourage­\nment to Irishmen (especially Oatholics) •to w01,k for \n:myt.hing. The sceptre of authority is wielded, by \nthose people as if they appeared t-0 be convi·noed tha.t \nthe Iiish a,re rea.lly a.n i-nferi<n· breed, and, therefore, \nnot supposed to look above their present level. Then, \ntoo, influence gets everything, and all the influence is \nwith the anti-Irish. To give the Postmaste1~Gene,raJ \nhis due, there is a mot.ice in staring black type inserted \nin ea.oh issue of the Post Office Circu!a.r to the effect \ntha.1i \"Influence does no good a.nd should no-t be sought.\" \nOf course it is read by everybody as an excellent bit of \nsly humour, ab least, no•body takes it seriously, aud the \ngood old game goes on, and eventua.lly works out; -to the · \ngood of \"Saved ga.rrison,\" who chuckle a:t the joke i:n the \nOfficial Circulai·. \nOnly those Irish, who happen to have patronage (they \nru·e ~nera.lly shoneens) are gifted with a.nything like \neasy jobs in wihich they manage to oome off with clear \nrecords. These, i.n order to keep their mean skins safe, \nbecome just as-antagonistic to the Irish as the \"Saved,\" \nso t,ha,t bhe mere Irish hn-ve nothi,ng to do but ti~ the \nordina.ry thor-ny paths exposed :to the lashes of :t.he \npeople a.hove. \nThe e-ffects of these conditions a-,re that there .is no \nincentiive to, progress or enterprise and a-st.-\\,te of inert,ia. \nfollows. What; the yotfnger men ha,ve to do is (1) to \nshake off the inertia a,nd indifference, and to ma.ke up \ntheir minds to ta.ke an active interest in getting a grip \nof overy bramch of their busi.ness. If they a.re denied \nopportunitiea to do so bhey musti fight for them. (2) \nWhen they ·have done t:Jhat they will then, and 1wt till \nthen, be in fit form t-0 attack the strongholds of the \nanti-Irish. \"Ag .\" \n--++--\nPOOR HUNGARY LOYALTY, \nDRAMATIS PERSON.IE \nBase } Bloodv -Chief Officers of the Green \nBrutal Government. \nSaxon \nHnnga.i-.ia.n \nPaddy A(}robat \nLar,•11 Balderdash ~ \nand r C hr-i.~t-i:e W ·i ldgoo.~r.cl, asr. \n-Gr%n Hungaria.n \nLeade1·s .. \nGreen Jfm1,r1nrio11s a·1ul b·-ishm.en. \nSoENE I.-Tbe star chamber of bhe Castle at Ba.Uy­\nbuda-pesth.

A tableau of the anti-Irish \npost office represe,nting Horatius of Riverstown in the \ndust and Egerton, the B1iitisher, of Dublin, making a \nlast staud for Englishism in the Post Office service of \nt..his country, wo -uJcl be :a welcome feature o.f next Su·il­\nday's procession. \nAgain, as Fa.ther Brennan, of Killarney, a, frontrra.nk \nma -n in Irish Ireland, suggests, the Language Wook \nshould ma.rk a special assa.ult on the anti-Irish Post \nOffice Give, it to them hot. E .ven though a few \nthousa.nd unnecessary stamps were bought from the \nB1-:itish Government, the money would be w'ell expended \nif it made . a stir in the Post Office service; it would \nhelp to ra.m the Post Office's anti-Irish spite down its \nown throat. \nNow bha.t St. Pat1-:ick's Day is a. re<:ognised holiday, \na.ncl the aotion of his Grace the Ai·chbishop in conjuuc­\ntio,n with the other forces workiug that way has probaibly \nknocked the ground from under the feet of the licensed \nspongers 011 St. Pa.trick in Dublin, it would be a good \nthing if ,a, leading note in the grea.t la.nguage procession \n--we hope the greatest that was ever seen in the stree.ts \nof Dublin-were a note of defiant reply to· the a,uti.­\nIrish action of the anti-Irish Post Office autho1J.-:ities. \nIrishmen a,re specially good 11.t fighting aga.·inst 11, tangible \nobjective; EgerLon, the imported Se<:reta:ry of the \nG .P.O ., Dubli-n, has supplied a seasona.ble \"Aunt Sally\" \nfor the wits of the Langua.ge Processio-n, a,nd it would \nbe 11, pity not to avail of the sport. The Language Pro­\ncession in Dublin is the an.nual ti-:iumpha.I march of Irish \nIrela.nd in the metropolis. The heart of it beats wibh \nthe determined thitd of a tra,11&-AtlanUc liner's engine, \nbut· it has·, and wisely, its lighter· and humorous side!, \nalso. The .anti-Irish Poot Office offers good treatment \nfor those who are looking ,after the lighter side as well \nit.s fo1, those whose teeth are set in the ca.use. Down \nwith the anti-I1-:ish Post Office by .all means; but it \nwould be .also .a, healthy a,nd a wholesome thing to make \nDublin laugh .at iit. Egerton, from .Britain, mig:ht as \nweU attempt to, drain the Atlantic with a,n imported \nB1-:itish sorver's hrut, as stop the full tide of Irish. Irela.ud; \n.a,nd he ought to be told so, and · well told so, d111-:iug \nLa.ngua,ge Week . \nThe following occurs in the Lenten Pastoral of his \nEminence Cardina.l Logue:-\" It is to be fen.red that \nnewspapers, indiscreetly conducted, contribute la.ri;,ely to \nthe mischief. It is <;erta,in that, with very few e-:zcep­\ntions, they encoura.ge, propagate, and mainta.in the gam­\nbling spirit among the people; but for this they claim a. \nkind of clrn.rtered right.\" Almost, needless to say, th<:, \nha'penny lndepemlent climbed the Pastora,l kopje on \nMonday. However, in view of ,the engagemeut of the \nBritish lady tipster it had to pick its steps ca.refully so \nt'ha.t it would .not bark its shins .i.gainst this sharp \nboulder; so, as might be expected, there is not a, word in \nthe Independent article concerning his Eminence's refer­\nen~ to the part that newspapers play'. in pandering to \nand sl.i.mulati•ng the awful betting evil that .afflicts this \npoo.r la.nd. His Grace, .tho Archbishop of Du9li11, a.lso \nrefers to the betting evil in his P~tora,l in the following \nwo1·ds: -\" The ruinous praclices of betting, ·a.nd of gam­\nbling in its various forms, which h.ave so ra.pidly gained \nground in our midst, still continue to st.rengthen their \nh?ld upon vast numbers of oµr people, even. upon many \nof the comparatively poor.

Previous to tihat time the Postmaster Genera.I \n• v,nd the \" Saved\" st-a.ffs of the Secretary's a,nd Surveyor's \nOffices could do what they liked with the Post Office in \nIreland. Postmasters, Engineers, Superintendents, etc., \narrived into this country as regula.r a.nd as numerous as \n\"the mails,\" and nobody seemed to ca.re much how or \nwhy it all happened. To say the least, the poor sub­\nservient hish had no st-rength or independence o.f spirit. \nThey' treated themselves more· or less ,a,s an infer.for class \nand seemed to be very well satisfied ·that they existed \nat all. In this respect lihey differed in ·no way from the \ngenerality of Ii-:is-hmen. It is only a case in point which \nclearly indicates those: s]a.vish a,nd inert cha.r.a-0teiistics \nwhich had gl'Ow.n into us. \nWith • the establishment of an Irish Association, the \nIrish at last began to wake up and to question -tJhese im­\nportations, and many other things which English Asso­\ncia.tions with ''dead and alive\" Irish branches never \ntroubled aboub. It is a good thiug ·this first sign of re­\nturning oonsci-ausness, and as t;he Irish ha.ve now fairly \nstarted on . the r-0a.d towards agita,tion on their own a.c­\ncoun•t, the foHowing short review of the situa.tion will \nperhaps be in seasonable time : -\nRegarding tJhe ag-itation for increase of pay a,nd con­\nditions of work, I sha.11 say nothing, as these questions \nchiefly concern the Postmaster-General and the Sta.ff. \nI will howeve:r, rema.rk that the deferred, pay system\" \nis the' most hollow mockery ever devised.

Egerton, t•he· imported \n,Secretary at tlie G.P.O., Dublin, has now-happi.ly for \nIrish IreJ.a.nd'--undismaye.cl by 1:Jhe. fate of Hoi:,atius of \nRiverstown, stepped into the· breach ,a,t, the G.P.O ., \nDublin. He h·as struck the, pole of combat outside the \ndoor of Irish Ireland. Poor Mr. Egerton, who bei,ng a \nBritisher, does not know this country, has done the \nright thing-from the Irish Irela,nd point of view I The \nwar with t,he anti-Irish post office needed no!Jhing so \nmuch as t;h.is tiime.ly interfere.nee o.f t,he G.P.O., Du!bl,in. \nHundreds of parce·ls addressed in, Irish from the head· \nqua.rters Qf the Gaelic League were turned a.way from \nt,he doors; thousa,nds of pa.reels a.nd l~tters will, of \neour.se, be the reply back straiglit ,between the eyes of \nMr. Egerton, t,be imported Secretary of the G.P.O., \nDubJ.in. Perhaps Mir. Egerton is only a factotum, and \n·may be only carrying out the instructions of his British \nmasters; but ~ mention his name .as !he is the Secre­\ntary of the G.P.O. a,nd .a B1itish imporlation like the \nEditor of -the Dust Bin. A tableau of the anti-Irish \npost office represe,nting Horatius of Riverstown in the \ndust and Egerton, the B1iitisher, of Dublin, making a \nlast staud for Englishism in the Post Office service of \nt..his country, wo -uJcl be :a welcome feature o.f next Su·il­\nday's procession. \nAgain, as Fa.ther Brennan, of Killarney, a, frontrra.nk \nma -n in Irish Ireland, suggests, the Language Wook \nshould ma.rk a special assa.ult on the anti-Irish Post \nOffice Give, it to them hot. E .ven though a few \nthousa.nd unnecessary stamps were bought from the \nB1-:itish Government, the money would be w'ell expended \nif it made . a stir in the Post Office service; it would \nhelp to ra.m the Post Office's anti-Irish spite down its \nown throat. \nNow bha.t St. Pat1-:ick's Day is a. re<:ognised holiday, \na.ncl the aotion of his Grace the Ai·chbishop in conjuuc­\ntio,n with the other forces workiug that way has probaibly \nknocked the ground from under the feet of the licensed \nspongers 011 St. Pa.trick in Dublin, it would be a good \nthing if ,a, leading note in the grea.t la.nguage procession \n--we hope the greatest that was ever seen in the stree.ts \nof Dublin-were a note of defiant reply to· the a,uti.­\nIrish action of the anti-Irish Post Office autho1J.-:ities. \nIrishmen a,re specially good 11.t fighting aga.·inst 11, tangible \nobjective; EgerLon, the imported Se<:reta:ry of the \nG .P.O ., Dubli-n, has supplied a seasona.ble \"Aunt Sally\" \nfor the wits of the Langua.ge Processio-n, a,nd it would \nbe 11, pity not to avail of the sport. The Language Pro­\ncession in Dublin is the an.nual ti-:iumpha.I march of Irish \nIrela.nd in the metropolis. The heart of it beats wibh \nthe determined thitd of a tra,11&-AtlanUc liner's engine, \nbut· it has·, and wisely, its lighter· and humorous side!, \nalso. The .anti-Irish Poot Office offers good treatment \nfor those who are looking ,after the lighter side as well \nit.s fo1, those whose teeth are set in the ca.use. Down \nwith the anti-I1-:ish Post Office by .all means; but it \nwould be .also .a, healthy a,nd a wholesome thing to make \nDublin laugh .at iit. Egerton, from .Britain, mig:ht as \nweU attempt to, drain the Atlantic with a,n imported \nB1-:itish sorver's hrut, as stop the full tide of Irish. Irela.ud; \n.a,nd he ought to be told so, and · well told so, d111-:iug \nLa.ngua,ge Week . \nThe following occurs in the Lenten Pastoral of his \nEminence Cardina.l Logue:-\" It is to be fen.red that \nnewspapers, indiscreetly conducted, contribute la.ri;,ely to \nthe mischief. It is <;erta,in that, with very few e-:zcep­\ntions, they encoura.ge, propagate, and mainta.in the gam­\nbling spirit among the people; but for this they claim a. \nkind of clrn.rtered right.\" Almost, needless to say, th<:, \nha'penny lndepemlent climbed the Pastora,l kopje on \nMonday. However, in view of ,the engagemeut of the \nBritish lady tipster it had to pick its steps ca.refully so \nt'ha.t it would .not bark its shins .i.gainst this sharp \nboulder; so, as might be expected, there is not a, word in \nthe Independent article concerning his Eminence's refer­\nen~ to the part that newspapers play'. in pandering to \nand sl.i.mulati•ng the awful betting evil that .afflicts this \npoo.r la.nd.

All of which, \nhowever, is not arguing that we a.i·e free from the vice \nof factiousne...<s. On the contra.ry, we are far too factious. \njust as we are far too fond of clriuk, for ou,,,. circ11,111-\nstances. But 1.ihe point is that, from constantly having \nthe cry of \"Fa.ctio.n !\" shout<Jd in our ears, and from, \nas I have w·ged, having ou-rse-lves come to slia.re the· be­\nlief tha.t w e a.re more factious tha,n any people on ea,rth, \nour every mov ement is pa-ralysed \\\\~ith fea.r of :traitors \nhere and traitors ·the,re, and the English G overnment a.I, \nthe bottom of the treacherous }Jin.us! Cousta,nt rubbiug \nor even itching keeps a sore ra.w , .a.nd this constant \nharping o,n \"United we stand, divided we fa.11,\" we aJ.\"e \nso accustomed to in Irela.nd is doing more tl1a.i1 people \nimagine to keep alive lihe bit of fact-ious spiri·t we have \nin us. The army can't get on that spends ha,lf its ,time \ncourt-ma.rtia.Uing and shoot;ing supposed traito•rs wh e,n it \nought to· be facing the enem y. \nAfter the qua.rrel between Gr atta.n and Flood, a,nd \nwhe.n the Dublin Parliament was m ost noisy, Barrington \nmade the remark that himself didn't see the necessity \nfor a.11 the fuss, seeing how gloriously the country wa s \nprospering. Perhaps we · might do w oroo tha,n ~imilarly \nask ourselves have we cause, when w e feel inclined to \nget e:x:cited now a,nd tihen. For, indeed, we have glori­\nfied what I may call -the policy of firing on the fishing \nboats. If Dublin is not .a, ca.pit,al in muck else, it cer­\nt~inly concentrates in it.self a good deal o.f our natio-nal \nsuspicion of foul play. Perhaps the Castle or Oastle \nhistory, has something to do with it, but anyhow , Thtb­\nli,n is fuller of plots, real 0 1· imaginary, than a,ny city \nI know. In fact, a man 's ingenuity in supposing plots \nis a, greaiter cla.im to clistinctfou in Dublin tha,n any \nother ta.lent or virtue almost. The ingenious one is f• \nsort of beacon with two lights, one exposing the subtle \nenemy before the eyes of the unsuspecting people•, the \nother shining i11wards on the operator's ow ,n spotless \nsoul. And the fun of it-js, the firs,t-mentioned light \nshows up so many t.raitors that the honest remnant of \nthe -na,tion can be but a. chosen (very) few! \nIt is a, good while now since \"Imaa.J\" wrote about the \namen ities of public life in Ireland. Well, of as much \nimportance as that our public men should be a bit mor e \ncivil to each other is, peroaps, that they should ceMe \nto bother the people with their suspicions. The English \nnewspaper man who comes over to interview someone at. \nthe beginning of the session with a view to eliciting who , \nin his opinion, is just then plotting to be chairman of \nthe Irish Party, is of courre, only poking .the Irish \ndonkey under the straddle for the fun of seeing him \nl10ise, but our own grown-up children who see the yellow \nof English gold in the pockets·of everyone that, start.les \nthem by •having an opinion o.f l1is own, and stat.i.ng it. \nam a nuisa,nce to have about on business days. I ha.ve \nstated my opinion that tihe Irish people are not more \nfactious than any other. What with leaders and plot \ndiscoverers, however, they hardly get a fair chance; in \nfact they are, or were until recently, being made fa.c­\ntious in spite of themselves. As it is their, perhaps, \nmost serious drawback as fighters is tha.t they a,re \napatilietic. To have the fear of faction ever before their \nminds is to keep -them a.pa,thetic. \nTo conclude, I don't know tha,L I have a,ny specific to \npropose for this nervous disorder of ours. Except one \nbe t-hat, i-nste.a.d of drumming plotte1·s out of public life, \nwe start and drum out, or laugh out, the pfotrfinders ! \ntn<\\l'l).(111. \nTHE DBEUtf OF ANTO~Y BUNG. \n'Twas on a, gay St. Patrick's Daiy, \n·In springtime fresh and _YOUn~. , \nEach gladsome ;throng wit;h mu·th a,long, \nTowards park and pastime swung, \n1 \nBut 'mid his sots, and pints and pots \nStood Antony the Bung. \n'.Dhat boozing pack ;wit,h liquor blade, \nThe shamrock s·adly ckowned. \nThe money's chink for each big drink \nMade sweet a.nd soothing sound ; \nY et still tJhe1,e hung upon the Bung \nA look of ca.i.-e profound. \n\"Oh , Tony Bung , some care has, clung \nUpo n thy heart so light, \nSom e weight of lead,\" a boozer sa.id, \n''Bears down thy spirit bright.\" \n\"Yes, such there be,\" said Antony, \n\"I had a dream last night.\" \n\"Some pha,ntom black of nightm are.'s rack, \nSuch things I know full well, \nSom e vision bred by midn ight dead \nUp on thy senses fell.\" \n\"Oh , boozy m an,\" t,be Bw1 g bega-n, \n';M y dream to 1.ihee I'll tel-I.\" \n\" 'T w as m orning fair, and on the air \nA rose each c4iming bell. \nT o M ass on fast the people passed \nTh eu; orisons to tell. \n'Twa s Patrick's D ay, and oh, disma,y, \nMy drink I could not sell. \n\" On pint and ca,n, there was a ban , \nMe thought up on them all, \nAnd no Bu ng d,are-'gainst it declat·6 \nFor fear to nought he'd fa.11. \nOh , sad was I, the crowds to spy \nAnd not to m ake a, haul. \n\" A s morning wore· they cam e before \nMy premises for beer; \nOh, T ony Bu ·ng, cried old an d young , \nAway thy shutters clear. \nDish out tihy booze, and don't refuse \nTh y thirsty clients here. \n\" Soon came a.Jo.ng a, mighty throng \n• From . nations far .and nigh, \nAnd loud they cried to be supplied \nThe y ,vere so awful dry. · \nSuch. -ha.rvest lost o.f beer down tossed \nWith grief did ma.ke me cry. \n\"And young a,nd old bright ye.Jlow gold, \nAnd silver shining bore. \nCome open wide for us, they cried, \nAnd let us drink ga.Jore \nTh.is money bright, we'll spend e'er night, \nIf you'll unba,r the door. \n\"That dazzling sight of gold so brio-ht \n·with greed possessed my braiu, \n0 \n' \nAnd down I bw'St to ease their thi1'St \nAnd ·half a, fortune gain. \nBut when I reached the door· I screeched· \nNot one did there remain.\" ' \n.Tha-t shocking stroke iny slumber broke \nAnd left me wild to th.ink, ' \nHow all thali gold a.nd we:a.lth untold, \nAll va.nished ,in a. wink. \n\"'Tw:as bad luck dead,\" the boozer said \n\" I'll h-a,ve anothe•r dr,ink.\" ' \nA.

Egerton, t•he· imported \n,Secretary at tlie G.P.O., Dublin, has now-happi.ly for \nIrish IreJ.a.nd'--undismaye.cl by 1:Jhe. fate of Hoi:,atius of \nRiverstown, stepped into the· breach ,a,t, the G.P.O ., \nDublin. He h·as struck the, pole of combat outside the \ndoor of Irish Ireland. Poor Mr. Egerton, who bei,ng a \nBritisher, does not know this country, has done the \nright thing-from the Irish Irela,nd point of view I The \nwar with t,he anti-Irish post office needed no!Jhing so \nmuch as t;h.is tiime.ly interfere.nee o.f t,he G.P.O., Du!bl,in. \nHundreds of parce·ls addressed in, Irish from the head· \nqua.rters Qf the Gaelic League were turned a.way from \nt,he doors; thousa,nds of pa.reels a.nd l~tters will, of \neour.se, be the reply back straiglit ,between the eyes of \nMr. Egerton, t,be imported Secretary of the G.P.O., \nDubJ.in. Perhaps Mir. Egerton is only a factotum, and \n·may be only carrying out the instructions of his British \nmasters; but ~ mention his name .as !he is the Secre­\ntary of the G.P.O. a,nd .a B1itish imporlation like the \nEditor of -the Dust Bin. A tableau of the anti-Irish \npost office represe,nting Horatius of Riverstown in the \ndust and Egerton, the B1iitisher, of Dublin, making a \nlast staud for Englishism in the Post Office service of \nt..his country, wo -uJcl be :a welcome feature o.f next Su·il­\nday's procession. \nAgain, as Fa.ther Brennan, of Killarney, a, frontrra.nk \nma -n in Irish Ireland, suggests, the Language Wook \nshould ma.rk a special assa.ult on the anti-Irish Post \nOffice Give, it to them hot. E .ven though a few \nthousa.nd unnecessary stamps were bought from the \nB1-:itish Government, the money would be w'ell expended \nif it made . a stir in the Post Office service; it would \nhelp to ra.m the Post Office's anti-Irish spite down its \nown throat. \nNow bha.t St. Pat1-:ick's Day is a. re<:ognised holiday, \na.ncl the aotion of his Grace the Ai·chbishop in conjuuc­\ntio,n with the other forces workiug that way has probaibly \nknocked the ground from under the feet of the licensed \nspongers 011 St. Pa.trick in Dublin, it would be a good \nthing if ,a, leading note in the grea.t la.nguage procession \n--we hope the greatest that was ever seen in the stree.ts \nof Dublin-were a note of defiant reply to· the a,uti.­\nIrish action of the anti-Irish Post Office autho1J.-:ities. \nIrishmen a,re specially good 11.t fighting aga.·inst 11, tangible \nobjective; EgerLon, the imported Se<:reta:ry of the \nG .P.O ., Dubli-n, has supplied a seasona.ble \"Aunt Sally\" \nfor the wits of the Langua.ge Processio-n, a,nd it would \nbe 11, pity not to avail of the sport. The Language Pro­\ncession in Dublin is the an.nual ti-:iumpha.I march of Irish \nIrela.nd in the metropolis. The heart of it beats wibh \nthe determined thitd of a tra,11&-AtlanUc liner's engine, \nbut· it has·, and wisely, its lighter· and humorous side!, \nalso. The .anti-Irish Poot Office offers good treatment \nfor those who are looking ,after the lighter side as well \nit.s fo1, those whose teeth are set in the ca.use. Down \nwith the anti-I1-:ish Post Office by .all means; but it \nwould be .also .a, healthy a,nd a wholesome thing to make \nDublin laugh .at iit. Egerton, from .Britain, mig:ht as \nweU attempt to, drain the Atlantic with a,n imported \nB1-:itish sorver's hrut, as stop the full tide of Irish. Irela.ud; \n.a,nd he ought to be told so, and · well told so, d111-:iug \nLa.ngua,ge Week . \nThe following occurs in the Lenten Pastoral of his \nEminence Cardina.l Logue:-\" It is to be fen.red that \nnewspapers, indiscreetly conducted, contribute la.ri;,ely to \nthe mischief. It is <;erta,in that, with very few e-:zcep­\ntions, they encoura.ge, propagate, and mainta.in the gam­\nbling spirit among the people; but for this they claim a. \nkind of clrn.rtered right.\" Almost, needless to say, th<:, \nha'penny lndepemlent climbed the Pastora,l kopje on \nMonday. However, in view of ,the engagemeut of the \nBritish lady tipster it had to pick its steps ca.refully so \nt'ha.t it would .not bark its shins .i.gainst this sharp \nboulder; so, as might be expected, there is not a, word in \nthe Independent article concerning his Eminence's refer­\nen~ to the part that newspapers play'. in pandering to \nand sl.i.mulati•ng the awful betting evil that .afflicts this \npoo.r la.nd.

The opening address to the large crowd was \ngiven by the Mayor, Phillip O'Donovan. In the course of a rambling \nspeech O'Donovan made it abundantly clear that if the new organisation \nin any way threatened the position of John Redmond he would be \nrecommending that people not join it. It was obvious from this speech \nthat political strains were showing even before the organisation had got \noff the ground and some of the Redmondite supporters would scupper \na volunteer movement if they were not in a position to control it. 62 \nResponding to the speech by the Mayor, Padraig Pearse, who was not \nat that time a member of the IRB, stated that the purpose of the new \nmovement was to unite all Irishmen regardless of politics and religious \npersuasion in a glorious cause. In an effort to assuage the concerns of \nthe Mayor, he said that the organisation had no politics only the 'liberty \nof Ireland from English domination'. He also stated that he personally \nwould have nothing to do with the movement if it in any way damaged \nthe cause of Home Rule. Pearse also emphasised that there was a great \nneed for drilling and organising to ensure that they were able to meet \n'circumstances that might imperil the chances of Home Rule'. \nSir Roger Casement then addressed the meeting and he drew \ncomparison with the manner in which the Boers in South Africa had \nstood up for their rights. He had fought in the Boer War Casement said, \n'entering it on the side of the greatest empire on earth but ending it on \nthe side of the Boers'. He had come to develop a great admiration for the \nBoers on account of the manly way in which they had fought and died \nagainst great odds. Michael O'Callaghan then addressed the meeting \n61 On 27 January 1914, Roger Casement wrote to John Daly thanking him for the hospitality \nshown to him by the Daly family while he was in Limerick. It is obvious from the tenor \nof the correspondence that a close bond had already built up between Casement and the \nol~ Fe~ian. In the course of the letter Casement requests that Daly send on copies of the \nLimerick Leader with reports of the meeting. He also expresses a wish to visit Limerick \nagain. - Folder 46 of the Madge Daly Papers in the University of Limerick. Thanks to Dr \nAngus Mitchell for pointing out this correspondence. \n62 Limerick Leader files - January 1914 \nThe Founding of the Limerick Volunteers to the 'Redmondite Split' 103 \nand his speech effectively extolled the merits of the points borne out by \nboth Casement and Pearse. R P O'Connor, who was involved in setting \nup the meeting and who was one of the party on the platform, was an \ninteresting if divisive character. O'Connor had been born in Boston and \nat an early age he became involved in the affairs of the Ancient Order of \nHibernians. He came to Ireland as an organiser of the AOH and he was \nknown as 'Boston Mass' on account of his birthplace. At this stage also \nMichael Colivet, who was later to play a very significant part in events, \nwas much 'hlore closely identified with the AOH than with any of the \nother bodies involved in setting up the Volunteers.63 \nBefore the meeting closed messages were read from a number \nof persons who were unable to attend including 'The O'Rahilly' and \nLaurence Kettle. An even more significant message was received from \nJohn Daly the old Limerick Fenian. In his letter Daly wrote, apologising \nfor his inability to attend, but significantly he tendered £20 towards \nthe setting up of Limerick's first Regiment of Irish Volunteers. Sean \nO'Muirthile then led the gathering in singing 'A Nation Once Again' \nthrough Irish, and the meeting was then concluded. Among those who \nattended the meeting at the Atheneum and who were to play an active \npart in the years ahead were Michael Hartney, James Gubbins, Liam \nForde and} J Qyilty. \nImmediately following the mass meeting, a Provi ional Committee that \nhad been set up to run affairs in the city started enrolling member . \nOperating from the Mechanics Institute in H artstonge Street, they \nactively sought membership and they also commen ed interviewing \ncandidates as to their suitability for drilling and training all new members. \nAmong the early drillmasters was Lieutenant Ch arle Holland who als \nappears to have been appointed as the very first Battali n mmander. \nThe first Adjutant appointed appears to have been a man by the name \nof Close, who was later to lose his life in the G reat Wa.r. \nA full route march of the new corps was arranged for St Patricks \nDay.

The march then started from their headquarters in Little \nBarrington Street, a building donated by the Daly family, and proceeded \nthrough Barrington Street and on to O'Connell Street. The ceremony \nculminated in a lecture in the Gaiety Theatre that was addressed by \nSean MacDermott. MacDermott was described by reports as being an \norator of 'rare ability'. The parade and lecture were held to mark the \nninth centePlary of the Battle of Clontarf. Whilst it was not directly \nassociated with the Volunteer Movement the activities of the Limerick \nSluagh of the Fianna were symbolic of all the strands of nationalism \nthat were beginning to express themselves. \nApril 1914 was an especially prolific month for the growth of the \nVolunteer Movement in the Limerick area. The Limerick Leader of 24 \nApril makes mention of two corps being established, one in Kilmallock \nand the other at Ardpatrick respectively. In the case of the Corps at \nKilmallock, Larry Roche of Dromin 66 was appointed to chair the \nmeeting, which was held in the Castle Hall. The meeting was attended \nby a large gathering and among those listed as attending were Nicholas \nGaffney, Joseph Gaffney, John Godfrey, John O'Connor, J O'Keefe, \nJames Ryan, John A Lynch, John Cahill, William O'Grady, David \nDwane 67 and John Moylan. It was proposed by Mr James Ryan that \nthe Kilmallock unit be named the 67th Regiment in memory of the \nFenians who rose in that year. Larry Roche, who chaired the meeting \nat Kilmallock, was a noted athlete and football player who had won \nan All-Ireland medal with the Limerick Senior Football team in 1896. \nRoche was listed among the attendance at the inaugural meeting at \nthe Rotunda in November 1913. Other interesting attendees at the \nKilmallock meeting were the Gaffneys and John Moylan who could \nclaim to be grandsons of men who had actually taken part in the attack \non the Kilmallock RIC Barracks in 1867. Moylan, who was listed as \n66 Larry Roche was a well known athlete who had won an All-Ireland, c.nior Football m dal \nwith Limerick in 1896.

Indeed Liam Manahan would claim that \nmeetings had been held in the area as early as December 1913 with a \nview to organising the volunteers in the area, but it was not until April \n1914 that the companies were formally inaugurated in the region.

Soon after its \nformation Tom Byrnes, a veteran of the Boer War, began to train and \ndrill the various companies. Indeed the pattern of ex-British military men \nlending assistance in training and organisation was a pattern that was \nto be repeated virtually everywhere the volunteer movement was being \nestablished. Manahan's accounts of the time mention that Sergeant Major \nGleeson from Kilworth Camp, who had recently retired from the British \nArmy was also very involved in training, organising and drilling. 70 \nIndependently of what was being organised from Dublin it appears \nthat the men in the Galtee Battalion were setting up their own system \nfor the procurement of arms. John Joe O'Brien records that in August \n1914 James O'Neill ofMitchelstown went to England and he managed \nto purchase 40 rifles and 4000 rounds of ammunition, in Birmingham, \nand that these arms were got safely back to Mitchelstown to arm the \nBattalion. The cost of the rifles was £5-5-0 each and that the money was \nraised by weekly instalments. 71 \nIn the Doon area of east Limerick, a company of volunteers was \nformed in May 1914. The man mainly responsible for the inception of \nthe Doon unit was Paddy (Pakie) Ryan who ran a hotel in the village. \nSoon the numbers involved in Doon were in the region of 100. The \ncompany had possession of a .22 rifle and a number of shotguns. But the \nmajority of the company had to make do with wooden rifles for training \nand drill purposes. Training and drill instruction in the Doon area was \ncarried out by an ex-British soldier named White. 72 \nIn the early summer of 1914 a company of Volunteers was formed \nin the Parish of Ballybricken. The person responsible for instigating \nthe volunteers in Ballybricken was Michael Doyle who had previous \nexperience in the Limerick city ·unit.

O'Briensbridge RIC Station \nwas a joint station with some of its personnel appearing on the Limerick County list of \nRIC and some of the personnel belonging to the Clare County List.

This was a position largely \nresented by the IRB and non-affiliated groupings but the power \nexercised in rural areas by the great ruling triumvirate of Church, school \nand family was not going to concede easily to what they saw as the \nencroachment of irresponsible youth. International events, however, \nwere to drive matters to a head much sooner than might otherwise have \nbeen the case. \nThe outbreak of War on 4 August 1914 saw a closing of ranks, by the \npolitical parties involved at Westminster. John Redmond saw it as his \nduty to throw the full weight of his office behind the efforts to prosecute \nthe war. On foot of this decision, and without reference to any centralised \ncommittee or to the governing committee of the volunteers, he committed \nthem to the support of the war effort. This decision was announced when \nhe addressed a political rally at Woodenbridge in County Wicklow on \n20 September 1914. Redmond's action at Woodenbridge had all the \nhallmarks of a man who had become out of touch with his grassroots \nsupport and who had begun to believe in his own infallibility. \nThe immediate consequence of Redmond's action was to cause a \ndisastrous split in the Nationalist movement. Because of the powerful \nand almost unchallenged position of his party, the vast majority of the \nVolunteer movement chose to follow him. Redmond decided to call \nthe volunteers, who followed him, the National Volunteers as against \nthe Irish Volunteers who chose to continue in their support for the \noriginal leadership. \nA second problem arose which has rarely been alluded to but which in \nits own way also caused a lot of upheaval to the Volunteer organisation, \nand it related to drill masters and instructors.

          "raw_text": "14 The War of Independence in Limerick \nSix chapters are devoted to the formation of the Irish Volunteers \n(November 1913); the split in the Irish Volunteers (20 September \n1914), after John Redmond committed the organisation to :fight in the \nFirst World War; the role of external advisers, such as Robert Monteith \nand Ernest Blythe, in the renewal and re-structuring of the Irish \nVolunteers, after the split with Redmond; the re-organisation of the \nLimerick Command Area into seven battalions in early 1916; and the \ninfluence of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, especially the role of \nJohn Daly, on the Volunteer movement. Inside this outline framework \nnames of people and places are given that provide a clear picture of \nLimerick city and county during the years before the Easter Rising, \n24 April 1916. The same comprehensive account is provided for the \nrole of the Irish Volunteers during the Rising itself: the failure to link \nup with Roger Casement's landing in Kerry, with the plan of securing \nGerman arms; and the decision, faced by conflicting orders from \nDublin, not to engage in armed revolt in 1916. Attention is paid to \nthe conflicting orders emanating from Patrick Pearse and the Military \nCouncil of the IRB and those of Eoin MacNeill, Chief of Staff of the \nIrish Volunteers, especially his countermanding order published in the \nSunday Independent, 23 April 1916. \nIn many ways the Limerick Volunteers were put in the same impossible \nposition as the Cork Volunteers who received about ten conflicting \norders in the weeks before the Rising. Subsequently, an inquiry by the \nVolunteer executive found that no blame should be apportioned to either \nthe Cork or Limerick Volunteer leaders for their failure to act in 1916. \nFor more on the Volunteers in Cork see an important essay by Gerry \nWhite and Brendan O'Shea, 'Easter 1916 in Cork - Order, Counter­\nOrder, and Disorder;' a title that tells its own story both for Cork and \nfor Limerick. (Gabriel Doherty and Dermot Keogh, eds., 1916 The Long \nRevolution, Mercier, 2007. The book also contains original essays on the \nrole of the Catholic Church and the Vatican in the Rising) Failure to \nact and the surrender of arms to the British authorities did, however, \ncause divisions in the rank and :file of the Volunteers. This was especially \nso in Limerick city where Toomey details the formation of a Second \n·' Foreword 15 \nBattalion of the Volunteers in Limerick City, in early 1917, with the \nexpress purpose of pursuing a more active programme than the First \nBattalion which had made the crucial decisions at the time of the Rising. \nThese divisions remained a simmering source of discontent for many \nyears. For more information on Limerick and the Rising see a valuable \nessay by John O'Callaghan, 'The Limerick Volunteers and 1916.' (Ruan \nO'Donnell, ed., 1he Impact of the 1916 Rising, Irish Academic, 2008) For \nnew information on the way in which Clare attempted to combine with e \nLimerick in 1916 and in later years, see Padraig Og O Ruairc, Blood on \nthe Banner. 1he Republican Struggle in Clare (Mercier, 2009) \nEvents in the years 1917 to 1918 radically changed the character of the \nIrish republican response to British rule in Ireland and are outlined in the \nbook. On the one hand, the British authorities attempted to introduce \nconscription in Ireland by the Military Service Bill (16 April 1918) and \nappointed General Sir John French as Lord Lieutenant (11 May 1918) \nto act, in his own words, as 'a Military Governor at the head of a Qyasi­\nMilitary Government.' (For more on this matter see, Richard Holmes, \n1he Little Field Marshal, 1he Life of Lord French, 2004) On the other hand, \na new republican Sinn Fein party and a new Volunteer organisation were \nformed, after Conventions were held in October 1917. The overwhelming \nsuccess of the Sinn Fein party in the general election of December 1918 \nand the assembly of that party as the parliamentary body of Dail Eireann, \n21 January 1919, provided the basis for the Irish Volunteers to act as the \nrepresentatives of a democratic authority. \nFor those who are interested in following up this transformation \nmore closely, with reference to source material, Irish Political Documents, \n1916-1949 (Irish Academic Press, 1985), edited by Arthur Mitchell \nand Padraig O Snodaigh, remains of great value. There one can find, for \nexample, the unanimous all-party Declaration of the Mansion House \nConference (18 April 1918) against Conscription in Ireland. Dorothy \nMacardle's The Irish Republic, :first published in 1937 and recently re­\npublished, is also valuable for its collection of original source material. \nThe book contains an appendix of almost ninety pages of documents \nand statements including the new Sinn Fein constitution of 1917 and,",

On at least one of these \noccasions he accompanied Blythe on his rounds. It appears that Blythe \nheld weekly officer training courses in Ballylanders. These courses were \nattended by officers from Ballylanders, Galbally, Ardpatrick, Kilfinnane \nand Mitchelstown. It also appears that it was during his period in the \nGaltee area that a Volunteer company was organised in the Anglesboro \narea. William Howard was elected Captain and other officers appointed \nwere Paddy Qyane, Ned Gallaghue and Jack English.94 Monteith also \n92 Massie Harnett, Victory and Woe (Dublin 2002) p.16 \n93 \nRobert Monteith, Casement's Last Adventure (Dublin 1953) p.50 \n94 \nDenis O'Dwyer, Ballylanders Barracks (Unpublished Manuscript) \nRe-organisation and Preparation far Rebellion 119 \nmentions that branches of Cummann na mBan were being organised in \nthe Galtee region at this time. Monteith gives a rare insight into their \nactivities as it appears that not alone were they involved in holding first \naid classes but they were also training in the use of firearms. 95 They were \nalso, he says, involved in recruiting for the Volunteers and raising funds \nby means of dances and outings. Indeed he makes it very clear that were \nit not for the Cumann na mBan in the Limerick area as a whole, it is \ndoubtful if the volunteers in the region would have reached the peak of \nexcellence that they did reach. \nVery soon it appears that the Volunteer movement was back on an \nefficient pitch with a rising sense of morale. Route marches, each Sunday, \nand training sessions up to four nights weekly ensured there was very \nlittle room for boredom. In contrast to the rise in the morale of the Irish \nVolunteers it appears that the fortunes of the more numerous National \nor Redmondite Volunteers were in sharp decline. At this stage their \nrole appeared to have been overtaken by events and that they had no \npurpose except for the supply of recruits to fill the depleted ranks of the \nIrish regiments in the trenches of Flanders. As the euphoria of the early \nweeks of the Great War dissipated so also did the morale of the National \nVolunteers as the horror of trench warfare were borne home. \nAn amusing incident in the Ballysimon area clearly illustrates the \ncontrasting fortunes of the two organisations. Whilst out on a route \nmarch in the Ballysimon area a body oflrish Volunteers passed the local \nNational Volunteer unit. Monteith's body were all armed and uniformed \nwhilst the Redmondites had only one rifle between them and it does not \nappear that they were too well uniformed either. The contrast brought \nhome to the Ballysimon men the futility of the road that they were on, \nand at their next meeting, they resigned in bloc and joined the Irish \nVolunteers and formed what ~as to become known as the Killonan \nCompany. Three of the more senior men in the Ballysimon Volunteers, \nBatt Laffan, David Hennessey and John McCormack were to become \nvery close friends of Monteith and they were to give him shelter at a \nfuture point when he was a fugitive from the RIC.

It appears that this \nmove was done at the behest of IRA Headquarters in Dublin. On their \nfirst night in• the West Limerick Brigade area the east Limerick men \nwere billeted in the Kilfinny area, for some time, before moving on to \nrendezvous with the men from the west.1062 The two flying columns met \nup at Athea on Spy Wednesday 30 March. Shortly after arriving in the \nAthea area the IRA were informed of a British Military lorry that was \nbroken down and under guard in a bog, not too far from the village. The \nIRA began surrounding the vehicle when it was realised that the lorry was \na decoy being used to lure the IRA into a trap.1063 Just in the nick of time \nO'Hannigan was able to extricate his men before they fell into the trap. It \nalso seems that information reached Sean Finn, from Thomas McDonagh \nin Newcastlewest, that a large scale round-up was imminent in the \nAthea area.1064 On foot of this information it was then decided to move \nthe combined columns north to the Ballyhahill area. The east Limerick \nColumn also had a spare supply of ammunition and some mines and these \nwere sent on ahead by horse and cart to Danaher's ofWoodcliffe, a large \nfarmer's residence in the hill country outside Ballyhahill. On the way to \nWhiskey Hall it seems that some of the IRA passed a 'tramp' walking \nthe road. It was later believed that what the IRA took to be a 'tramp' was \nactually a British agent trying to pin down where the IRA was situated. \n1061 \n1062 \nWhen Patrick O'Gorman died in England, in the 1950s, and news reached the east \nLimerick area that his remains were being brought home, some former comrades of \nWilly Slattery and Ned Crawford issued threats about interfering with the remains. \nWhen Monsignor Slattery, PP of Lattin, uncle ofWilly Slattery heard about these \nthreats he forbade any interference and O'Gorman's remains were interred peacefully at \nLattin. - Interview with Liam Slattery Mitchelstowndown, Garryspillane,January 2008. \nWIS 600 Witness Statement ofDonnchadh O'Hannigan (Bureau of Military History) \np.29 \n1063 WIS 891 Witness Statement of Maurice Meade (Bureau of Military History) p.37 \n1064 LimericH Fighting Story AJ O'Halloran (ed).

Their numbers were \nnow swelled by numbers from the lanes around Carey's Road which \nwas a very strong recruiting area for the British Army. At this stage the \nVolunteers were again surrounded .and hemmed in, in the area around \nthe railway station. A number of young volunteers were attacked and \nhad their arms seized. \nThe intervtntion of the director of the Arch Confraternity, Father \nMangan succeeded in calming down matters and he managed to \npersuade members of the mob to return the guns which had been taken. \nInterestingly the RIC took no meaningful part in trying to restore \norder until some of the Volunteer Officers made it clear that they were \nprepared to open fire if the mob did not move back and calm down. The \nattitude of the RIC up to that seemed to be one of tacit compliance \nin the embarrassment of the Volunteers and, whilst the mob held the \nupper hand, they seemed to be smugly content. Eventually some sort \nof order was restored and the various detachments of volunteers left \nby rail for their destinations. The disturbances of that day were to have \nrepercussions in the years ahead but for the moment at least some form \nof peace was restored. \nThroughout the summer of 1915, the Irish Volunteer Movement \ncontinued to train and expand whilst the National Volunteer Movement \nwent into decline.

      "raw_text": "14 The War of Independence in Limerick \nSix chapters are devoted to the formation of the Irish Volunteers \n(November 1913); the split in the Irish Volunteers (20 September \n1914), after John Redmond committed the organisation to :fight in the \nFirst World War; the role of external advisers, such as Robert Monteith \nand Ernest Blythe, in the renewal and re-structuring of the Irish \nVolunteers, after the split with Redmond; the re-organisation of the \nLimerick Command Area into seven battalions in early 1916; and the \ninfluence of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, especially the role of \nJohn Daly, on the Volunteer movement. Inside this outline framework \nnames of people and places are given that provide a clear picture of \nLimerick city and county during the years before the Easter Rising, \n24 April 1916. The same comprehensive account is provided for the \nrole of the Irish Volunteers during the Rising itself: the failure to link \nup with Roger Casement's landing in Kerry, with the plan of securing \nGerman arms; and the decision, faced by conflicting orders from \nDublin, not to engage in armed revolt in 1916. Attention is paid to \nthe conflicting orders emanating from Patrick Pearse and the Military \nCouncil of the IRB and those of Eoin MacNeill, Chief of Staff of the \nIrish Volunteers, especially his countermanding order published in the \nSunday Independent, 23 April 1916. \nIn many ways the Limerick Volunteers were put in the same impossible \nposition as the Cork Volunteers who received about ten conflicting \norders in the weeks before the Rising. Subsequently, an inquiry by the \nVolunteer executive found that no blame should be apportioned to either \nthe Cork or Limerick Volunteer leaders for their failure to act in 1916. \nFor more on the Volunteers in Cork see an important essay by Gerry \nWhite and Brendan O'Shea, 'Easter 1916 in Cork - Order, Counter­\nOrder, and Disorder;' a title that tells its own story both for Cork and \nfor Limerick. (Gabriel Doherty and Dermot Keogh, eds., 1916 The Long \nRevolution, Mercier, 2007. The book also contains original essays on the \nrole of the Catholic Church and the Vatican in the Rising) Failure to \nact and the surrender of arms to the British authorities did, however, \ncause divisions in the rank and :file of the Volunteers. This was especially \nso in Limerick city where Toomey details the formation of a Second \n·' Foreword 15 \nBattalion of the Volunteers in Limerick City, in early 1917, with the \nexpress purpose of pursuing a more active programme than the First \nBattalion which had made the crucial decisions at the time of the Rising. \nThese divisions remained a simmering source of discontent for many \nyears. For more information on Limerick and the Rising see a valuable \nessay by John O'Callaghan, 'The Limerick Volunteers and 1916.' (Ruan \nO'Donnell, ed., 1he Impact of the 1916 Rising, Irish Academic, 2008) For \nnew information on the way in which Clare attempted to combine with e \nLimerick in 1916 and in later years, see Padraig Og O Ruairc, Blood on \nthe Banner. 1he Republican Struggle in Clare (Mercier, 2009) \nEvents in the years 1917 to 1918 radically changed the character of the \nIrish republican response to British rule in Ireland and are outlined in the \nbook. On the one hand, the British authorities attempted to introduce \nconscription in Ireland by the Military Service Bill (16 April 1918) and \nappointed General Sir John French as Lord Lieutenant (11 May 1918) \nto act, in his own words, as 'a Military Governor at the head of a Qyasi­\nMilitary Government.' (For more on this matter see, Richard Holmes, \n1he Little Field Marshal, 1he Life of Lord French, 2004) On the other hand, \na new republican Sinn Fein party and a new Volunteer organisation were \nformed, after Conventions were held in October 1917. The overwhelming \nsuccess of the Sinn Fein party in the general election of December 1918 \nand the assembly of that party as the parliamentary body of Dail Eireann, \n21 January 1919, provided the basis for the Irish Volunteers to act as the \nrepresentatives of a democratic authority. \nFor those who are interested in following up this transformation \nmore closely, with reference to source material, Irish Political Documents, \n1916-1949 (Irish Academic Press, 1985), edited by Arthur Mitchell \nand Padraig O Snodaigh, remains of great value. There one can find, for \nexample, the unanimous all-party Declaration of the Mansion House \nConference (18 April 1918) against Conscription in Ireland. Dorothy \nMacardle's The Irish Republic, :first published in 1937 and recently re­\npublished, is also valuable for its collection of original source material. \nThe book contains an appendix of almost ninety pages of documents \nand statements including the new Sinn Fein constitution of 1917 and,",

The immediate descendants of Cromwell 's original troopers were found speaking Irish about the time of the Revolution. The Gael is not now what he wa s then but all the sam e, he may manage to mak e history repeat itself in thi one point. We need not expect to hear a Lord 'Dun raven delivering the Oireachtas oration yet a bit. Ve can, however , see to it that both he and others recognise and bear in mind that this is Ireland, not England , nor any part thereof. Tlia.t much seen to for the present, the future will look after itself. So much for the situation from the ua,tiomd stand­ point; from the political standpoint it is not less in­ teresting.

The inevitable \n•_consequence would be that the Irish Industrial Revival, \nin so far as that movement means the helping on of \nIrish industry by the support of the Irish consumer , \n·would be laughed out of existence as a fad, and would \nhave succeeded only in strengthening the prejudice \nagainst Irish goods, increasing the apathy concerning \n-them, and helping further to frighten away capital \nfrom Irish industrial enterprises. \nWe would be glad to have the views for publication \n-of those who are most directly concerned in the Indus­\ntrial Revival, viz., the manufactm·ers themselves. \nD;o you as a manufacturer wish it to go forth that \n-you desire a grant in aid from your customers and the \n·public'1 Or do you claim \"to meet foreign goods fairly \n·in the matter of price and quality 1 Do you sell on \nmerits, or would you wish it to go forth that as an Irish \nmanufacturer you wanted to unload your goods as \n·against non-Irish goods of a similar class on the strength \n-of a sentiment involving a pecuniary sacrifice from your \n-customers 1 Do you consider it would injure your own \nindustry-ven though you may be giving better value \nthan outside competitors-if the view gained any volume \nthat people were expected to pay more for goods in the \n:market because they were Irish 1 \nr would be glad to get an expression of your views \nfor·publication.-:Yours truly, D.

We \nhave no sympathy with the-no doubt, well-intentioned \n--effort which is being made of late to \" spoon-feed \" \n.Irish industries, convinced, as we are, that a revival \n·movement, conducted upon the lines of paying a higher \nprice for an article merely because it is Irish, is abso­\n:Iutely impracticable as :well as unjust to the community \nat la,rge; a few manufacturers might, while the wave of \n,enthusiasm continued, reap a temporary benefit, but we \nbelieve that the ultimate result would be disastrous to \nIrish manufacture generally,, Speaking for ourselves, \nwe claim to compete fairly and squarely with the im­\n_ported article in the matter of quality, price, and \n\"G .ENUINE,, TRINIDAD OOOOA.BHELLS IC :&X­\nC.,'ELBIOB \" BRAND; tJut bnt; proour~ba; 17-, \n,M other. \n\"make-up\" of our paper. Like many other manufac­\nturers, we have experienced something. of th_e unreason­\nable prejudice and apathy wl~ich ha,~ ex1st~d i?, i:eg~r~ to \nIrish manufactlll'e, but by dmt of pushmg Jl~dIC1ous \nadvertising and maintaining uniformity of quality and \nfinish we have overcome those obstacles, and om· \" Mill \nNo. 32\" make of paper-every ream of which bears om· \nlabel as a gum:antee of Irish m anufacture-is now known \nall over Ireland, and both our wholesale friends and the \nconsumers n.re glad to have it; and we have, durin~ the \npast few years, steadily increased our output. Tins re­\nsult could not have been achieved by such artificial \nmeans as \"bolstering up .\" \nWe beg to say further that we are satisfied nothi.n-g \nbut injury could accrue to our own, and every other \nIrish industry, if such a foolish doctrine be disseminated \nas that which involves, in the case of Irish manufacture, \na pecuniary sacrifice upon the part of our customers. In \nconclusion, we wish to add that we are altogether op­\nposed to any measure being adopted which, while con­\nferring a transitory and questionable benefit upon a few \nIrish manufactlU'ers or m erchants, would undoubtedly \npress unduly upon the great mass of our people, includ­\ning the working classes, who se resources, to say the \nleast of it, are not unlimited. \nThanking you for yom· consistent and common sense \nsupport of home industries, we remain, yours faithfully, \nS.

A spirit of inquiry as to the value of home­\nmanufactm·ed goods should be encouraged, and would \nsoon lead to the development of those worthy of patron­\nage. A.s to the rest, until ~om~one arrives abl~ to :pro­\nduce them of equal value with imported goods, it_ would \nbe well for them to remain in abeyance. By askmg as­\nsistance for these lame dogs you place the whole system \nof Irish manufacture on a low basis.

VVe, for our part, \nbeg to suggest that \" all true friends of the movement '' \nwould be better employed in disa:ssociating a noble and \nhonourable cause from all connection with street blaok­\nguardism and foot-pad tactics. It is for the 1mr• \nticular Irish public concerned to differentiate if they \ncan .between tweedledum and tweedledee. There is no \napology to Dr. McWalter, T.C., to his friend Mr. John \nGore, or to the Editor of this paper. What are these \ntrio compa ,red to the street roughs, their aiders, ab­\nbetors and applauders 1 Were there men who must not \nbe disobeyed by the majority of the Coir-oe 511ot\" at \nthis meeting around the corner on Thu rsday night last? \nThe resolution of the Executive Committee appears \nto us to be quite absurd as well as an aggravation of \nthe insult offered to Dr. M 'Walter, T.C., and his friends \nin the streets of Dublin on the occasion of the Proces­\nsion. Surely it was unnecessary to formally declai:e \nthat that body regretted that the harmony of the Dub­\nhn Procession was disturbed; we should have thought \nthat that might be taken for granted; all people con­\ncerned in any enterprise natw-ally wish that it should \nbe carried out harmoniously, and one would think it \nrather unnecessary for them to state that, street roughs \nintervening, they regretted the want of harmony. Of \ncow-se they did; so would any collection of human be­\nings; and the particular want of harmony having led \nto other more serious disturbances in the way of branch \nresolutions, protests, etc., naturally the regret is inten­\nsified. Surely no one who protested and asked for an \napology thought that the Co1r'Ce 5110.t,1 organised the \nstreet-rough escapade! Why, then, point out that the \nblackguardism was enacted by \" persons acting without \nauthority \" The Organisation, in many devious ways, \nas we have over and over again shown, had got itself \nexpressly mixed up in the matter, yet the Executive \nCommittee did not feel called upon to express even a \nformal regret 'to D1:. M 'W alter, T .C., and his friends on \naccount of the blackguardism to which they were sub· \njected by roughs at the Procession, one of whom wore a \nbadge upon his arm . The absurd resolution as it stands \nreally in a round-about way emphatically says:- \" We \ndon't wish to, or we dare not, offer any apology, \nor denounce the conduct of the street roughs.'' \nThat is the meaning of the resolution in so far as it \nmeans anything; and it appears to ·us that the long­\ndrawn-out exhibition of lack of tact is fully capped by \nthis resolution of the Executive Committee who have \nadded aggravation after the Dublin Co1r-oe Ce .<11111-\nC.(\\IJI had added insult to injury. \nSupposing that a vofo of condolence was proposed at a \nmeeting of responsible persons to the relatives of some­\none who had recently died, and supposing that meeting \nresolved that as they had nothing to do with bringing \nabout the death of the person they considered that no \naction on their part was called for-what would be \nthought of such a resolution 1 Dr. M'W •alter and his \nfriends are to receive no apology as the Executive Com­\nmittee did not authorise the roughs--one with a badge \non his arm-to hold up the carriage of a member of the \nDublin Corporation invited to the Procession ! Those \nbranches of the Gaelic League and individuals who have \nexpressed their regret at the blackguardism must . be \ni:adly lacking in that luminous and subtle intellectua­\nlity which, perhaps, for ought we know, may distin­\nguish the resolution of the Executi:ve Committee; for \nthese did not authorise the blackguarclism either, al­\nthough they vigorously condemned it I We note that \nthe ExecuUve, having emphaticii.lly declined ~o e~press \nany regret to D1·. M'Walter, T.0., and his friends·, \nand having declined to denounce the street roughs, \ntrust that no more will be said about the matter. That \nalso is brilliant.. If a company owed five thousand \npounds to their creditors, and resolved that t~ey would \nnot pay it, it would be very brilliant on their part to \nsuggest that, in the interests of peace and quietness, \nthere should be no more said about the matter by the \ncreditors and their friends. The Executive Committee \nsurely owed an expression of regret to Dr. M'Wal~er, \nT.C., and his guests. Either not wishing or not danng \nto pay it, they hope that no more will be said about \nt:heir liabilit,y. \nNow, supposing that Dr. M'Walter and his friends \ndid not keep control of their tempers, and suppose that \none of the roughs applauded by a \" confrere \" of the \nofficial organ of the Gaelic League was struck, and tliat \na riot and bloodshed ensued, as easily might have hap­\npened; supposing a few corpses were laid out in the \nMorgue, would the Executive Committee resolve that as \nthey did not authorise the slaughter that no action on \ntheir part was called for? Who will be the victim next \nyead Supposing that the .Ai·chbishop of Dublin at­\ntended the Procession next year, and that be was as­\nsa,ulted by a gang of roughs, one with a badge on his \nsleeve, would the E .xecutive Committee, in solemn con­\nclave assembled, say that as the roughs assaulted the \nArchbishop without authority, no action was called for \non their part? \nIs the influence represented by street roughs dominant \nin the Central Counsels of the Gaelic League 7 Is the \npolicy of the Ex ecutive dictated by fear of street roug4s \nand their friends 7 We had hoped to be able to bury \nthe incident in this week 's issue ; the Executive Com­\nmittee have not seen w ell to dig a pit in which we could \nplace it and cover it up . They have aggravated a dis­\nagreeable situation, and have refu§ed to rub the gutter \noff the organisation with which the roughs at the Lan­\nguage Procession succeeded in fouling it. \nWe feel sure that the members of England's Faithful \nGarrison in Ireland , the reo111i11i, the West Britons and \nother enemies of Ireland feel that they owe a debt of \ngratitude to the DublinC01ru eCe ,,1111c<1111, to the roughs, \nand last but not least to the m em hers of the Executive \nCommittee responsible for the absurd resolution passed \nlast Thursday. \nThe resolution of the majority at the Executive Com­\nmittee meeting is in opposition to several of the \nbranches who had thought it well to declare upon \nthe matter beforehand. We do not know how many \nbranches thought well to move in the matter; we pre­\nsume that most branches, looking forward confidently to \nthe Executive Committee doing the tactful and the right \nthing, took no action in the hope that the crisis would \nbe got over by proper action on the part of the Execu­\ntive. The resolution of the Executive is in op­\nposition to the Gavan Branch, the committee of which \nunanimously agreed in asking whether any step had \nbeen or would be taken to repudiate the action of the \nroughs. It is opposed to the view of the Father \nSherlock Branch, Birmingham, whose President wrote \nin a letter already published by us that he was authorised \nby tha~ branch \" to_ protest in its name against the in­\n~u;lt ?ffered to you m the Language Procession, and to \nJOrn_m the c\\ema11d that you shall receive adequate satis­\nfact1011 for the same from the authorities of the Gaelic \nL~ag1;1e.\" I~ is ;ontrai:y to the Cleaver Branch , \nDublm, who, m thei_r pubhshed resolution called \"upon \nth~ Co,r-oe Eno~ ~'. 1~1 t~e name of the League to dis­\nclann all responsi~nh~y m the matter, and to condemn • \nthe a1~thors of the mcident.\" It is out of line with the \ncommittee of the Clonmel B:ranch, who resolved-u-T'hat \nwe, the me~bers of the Clonmel Branch of the Gael~~ \n~eague, desire to record our deep regret that the govern­\nmg ~ody o~ the_League has not before now thought well \nto disassociate itself from any appearance of sympathy . \n. 1 \ni \nt \nI \n,I \nI· \nl \n\\· \n!",

It is not, how-\n. ever, very_ probable that any new aristocracy the future \nmay find rn Irel11;u~ will ever inspire that old affection. \nA1~d at th~ best it is a long cry, from the Irish-Ireland \npo11;1t of \".iew, till we ca,n hope to have anything like a \n!1at~v~ a.nstocracy.

Aud yet one never knows. It is \neasier, after all, to bring the ext,reme points of a bow \nto~ether tha1! it is to _bend either of them to touch any \npornt_ of the ~utermed~ate arc. Similarly it is often, rn \npractice, easier to brmg an aristocrat into the Gaelic \nLeague than it is to bring a member of our so-so middle \nc!ass into it. Altogether 'tis a most interesting opera­\ntion to wa .tch or speculate on, this Irish-Ireland Grind. \nIrish-Irela.ndei:s are naturally impatient, but it is \nbetter not to be m too great a hurry with the mill. It \nwas ~ortun:1-te, if one may so put it, that the Irish-Ire­\nland idea did not emanate with the Garrison. It will be \nno great harm either, if the Garrison holds out to the \nlast minute refusing to surrender. \" Te are not strona \nenough yet to assimilate t,hem ; if they joined the Gaeli~ \nL~ague. in full force just now they would possibly assi­\nmilate it and us.

The \nelate is Sunday, July 23rd, and on that day we hope \nthat every Lord Mayor and every Mayor in Ireland, \nwith all the splendour of their paraphernalia, will march \nup the magnificent aisle of Westminster Catholic Oathe­\ndral and appear at the sermon of Archbishop Bourne . \nEvery Gaelic League in Ireland, and every lover of \nIreland not a Gaelic Leaguer owes a debt of gratitude to \nthe Archbishop of Westminster. The St. Patrick's Day \nceremony in Irish, when the Bishop of Raphoe preached, \ngladdened the heart of every Irishman in London and \npoured a sterner soul into the minds of those in'i1abi­\ntants of the modern Babylon whose fathers and grand­\nfathers had been Irish, but who are now betimes tempted \nto be a trifle ashamed of that troublous laud. That \nscene and tha_t sei'vicc was a purple patch on the dreary \ngrey_ ~f the hves of th?se who strive to keep alive the \ntrad1t1ons of the old faith and the old land in London. \nNow an opportunity arises, not only to mark Ireland's \nsense of appreciation for Archbishop Bourne's act, but, \nalso to create another memorable day for the London \nIrish. \nThe Royal Institute of Public Health holds its Annual \nCongress in Loudon this year, and the Mayors or other \ndelegates from every Sanitary Authority in Britain \nand Ireland are invited to attend, in· order to discuss \nCeltic Art Jewellery. \nW o are actu&l manufacturer■ of enr;r kind \nof Irish Art Jowellery, whioh wo produce {n \nour own workshops on the prcmh:ee. \nWo apeclaliao tho making of tho follo'll\"ing \nwell-known and beo.utiful brooohes :-\nTho T .. rn., Toro, Bn.Uinderey, Fibulae InnJ,. \nhow en, Kilkenny, etc., any of which' oau bt \nhad in either gold or silver. \nMed •nla and badges, our own original d.,_ \nsigns, mnnufnotorod at lowest pricea. \nHOPKINS & HOPKINS, \nmanufacturing Jtwdlus, Sih,usmitbs, \nWatcb and Clockmak~rs, \nThe Waltham Watch Depot, \nOpposite O'Connell Monument, DU8l.lN. \nPRAYER BOOKS. \nMessrs.
