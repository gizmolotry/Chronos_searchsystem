Th~ present west end of church, with window, was built at the \nsame time. At this time the revenue of Liathmore belonged to the \nTreasurer of Cashel Cathedral, and the d·uties were probably perforn1ed \nby a vicar, for whon1 a residence \\vas-provided.

Probably the superstition was preserved by some of the \ncastle builders, who 1nade use of those from the ruined churches, or had \nnew ones carved for the same purpose. The tr~atment of this figure, \nand its adoption as a decorative feature in this position is unique. \nT,vo of the stones on the imposts on the north side of the chancel arch, \nhave carving in lo,v relief which I consider worth reproducing.

He instances it in the \n•baptistry of St. Jean at Poi tiers erected in the first years of the. eleventh \n,century, and adds, \"in this connection it is interesting to note that just at \nthe time of Benedict Biscop there is evidence of direct contact between \nthe north of England an'.i Poitou, in a fragment of the will of Ansoald: \nBishop of Poitiers (682-696) from which ,ve learn that he appointed a \n'Bishop named Romanus, from. the land of the Scoti, accompanied by a \n·band of his countrymen to govern and occupy the monastery of \n¥azerolles sur Vienne, ,vhich had been restored by him.'' Rivoira here \nfalls into the same error as some other writers, by taking the \" land of \nthe Scoti\" to mean Scotland, from ,vhich he believes this style passed \n,into England through Northumbria; but it is no,v well known that from \nSt. Jerome's time, and on even to the twelfth century Ireland was the \nonly country known as Scotia, so that it is through Ireland, this feature \nof Romanesque architecture is most likely to have passed from France \ninto Britain, and it may safely be conjectured that to this early \nintercourse, both Ireland and England owe many of the features common \nto the early architecture of the three countries. \nFrom the sixth century the Irish monks had helped to spread the \nlight of Christianity amongst the nations of Europe and were the life \n, ·spring of Mediaeval culture.

The most obvious rules of induction, then, point to the conclusiqr:i, \nthat these are the remains of buildings of Anglo Saxon date.\" The \nargument might be carried further in the case of Irish architecture, by \nconsidering the superiority of the Irish sculptors of the tenth century,. \nto the Anglo-Saxons which ,vould naturally affect the details of Irish, \nchurch architecture,, so that ,vith a direct inspiration from Gaul, th_e· \nstyle known as Norman, would develop here earlier and more rapidly· \nthan in England, ,vbere it was derived from the sa1ne source. \nTh e two figures carved on the san1e stone before referred to may be· \nseen in the view· of the south door, built in over the arch between two .. \ncarved heads.

Each of these headings is a\nremarkable achievement in itself and something to be proud of,\nbut greatest amongst them, to my mind, is that which deals with\nthe discipline of our players. In that respect, the year 1943\nstands as a headline and an inspiration for the years to come. In\nthe eleven matches played for the Munster Championships, there\nwas not a single unworthy incident and when we remember that\nthey generated a crescendo of excitement culminating in the\nclimax of the finals, with players strained to the utmost in the\nmajority of the matches—a point or two being the margin in many\ncases—we are forced to pay tribute to the gallant manliness of\nour Munster Gaels, and may their successors emulate their splen-\ndid example,",

But that's another column. So ..... . \nAFFIE YUSSUF is a man hovering in the space \nbetween the techno soul of Chicago and the techno \nexperimentation of Europe . He deals in deepness, and \non his newie 'SAUCER SHAPED OBJECTS', the name of \nBOO WILLIAMS springs instantly to mind. This is a • \nrecord which will appeal to some house fans and some \ntechno heads but probably not to all of any genre. Not \nthat there's anything sub-standard about the release : \nIt is, in fact, quite excellent. \nIn the early '80s that merry band NEW ORDER took \noff to the good old U.S.of A. where they teamed up \nwith ARTHUR BAKER . They returned with a \nblueprint for music which is still relevant today. 'BLUE \nMONDAY ' went on to become the best selling 12\" of \nan age and now - IO years later -has proven to be as \ntruly ahead of its time as SLY or MARVINs best mate­\nrial was in their own heyday. But now it's '95 and \nHARD FLOOR (who else) have emerged with their \ninterpretation. The German duo keep the vocal and \nbasic song structure while inserting the obligatory big \nbreakdown and adding a mind-blowing acidic under­\ncurrent. 1AM & SPOON contribute a nu-energy -ish \nversion, not quite up to the standard of \ni \nHARDFLOORs mix, but amaze w ith an incredible I \nambient dub (yes - ambient dub) . And w ith the still \nfresh-sounding original included it all adds up to a \npackage of distinction. \nFlying out of BLACKSPOT this past week has been \nST . GERMAINs 'BOULEVARD '. Hailing from the same-\nnamed Parisian suburb, ST . GERMAIN is the brain­\nchild of one LUDOVIC NAVARRE . NAVARRE has, in \nthe past, bee responsible for deep techno records \nunder the name of MODUS VIVENDI and DEEPSIDE, \nbut it was on the release of the 'BOULEVARD 'series of \n3 E.Ps (collected here on a double album) that his \nn~me really shot into the spotlight. 'BOULEVARD' is \nnot techno. It is beautiful natural music. It is House, it \nis dub reggae, it is soul and hip hop and it is most defi­\nnitely jazz. The tunes (played by real musicians) are \nfrom Paris via New York but never lose their originali­\nty. A track-by-track listing is not really required and \nwould be pointless. Suffice to say that if you enjoy \ndeep MASTERS-type house music, you probably won't \nfind a more accomplished record as this all year. \nElsewhere 'HOOKED' by 99th FLOOR ELEVATORS \nfeatures a TONY DE VITmix (he of TRADE) and not \nmuch else really.

From the five song s on the tape one cannot \nbut get the impression that they take them selves very \nseriously. Hailing from in and around the city ,the \nH erm have been on the go for a year or so now gigging \naround various hostelries. \nI mu st concede that I was very excited listening to the \nopen ing bars of the first song. Okay so the four chords \nit's based around have been done to death but for m e \nit was the voca ls w hich enthralled, managing to get \nuncannily close to \"slow ly goes the night\" era of Nick \nCave .Unfortunately , the said vocalist soon decided \nthat rather than sounding like Australia's greatest \nCabaret singer, he'd like to emulate the 'least articu­\nlate man to scream in.to a Shure SM5 8' -yes I am talking \nabout Eddie Vedder . Despite relatively goo d sound \nquality(especially in the context of dem o tapes) ,on \nsome tracks it was impossible to work out the lyrics. \nThat said,when they were coherent,they seemed \nsomewhat disjointed and perhaps relying too much \non the usual rock cliches : \"Darkest dreams , deepest \nfears\"etc. The instrumentation is top notch with good \nbalance between th~ musicians and this alone.should \nhold them in good stead. Herm show considerable \npromise but they really ought to lighten up.

And this \nwas just the queue for th e train ti \nup ,Wake up. , .... No , it's not the \nBOO RADLEYS song but the shouting o f the s ta­\ntion ma ster, telling us to get o ff the noon \ntrain . Dragging our F amily sized tent with us, \nwe em erged into the bright sunlight ( that \nwas to continue for the wh ole o f the next \nthree days) and proceeded directly to .... the \nnear est pub.A few hours later , we em erged \nfrom there, back into t he the cool even ing \na ir , and proceeded to the campsite by bus. \n__ We~l , what we thought was the c amp site. It \nwas in fac t at the end of a track about a \nmile long sober and abou t e ight miles long \ndrunk.We set up the tent beside a large \nmarque e (which we naturally assumed was \nkind o f alcohol selling establishment) and \nheaded on for Paire Ui Ca oimh wh ich - a ll the \nway back up the forest track and abou t tw ice \ntha t d istance aga in. Considering there w as \nabou t 20,000 there it didn't take us long to \nfind p eop le w e knew and i t took them an even \nshorter time to tell us we 'd missed ASH,PWEI \nand GRASSHOPPER - the very bands we 'd come \ndown on Friday to see . Being ace L .E .G jour­\nnalists we naturally headed b ack stage. The \ncrowd there consisted of 99% of people like \nus, looking around for s omeb ody famous . Unf or-\ntunately the mi nute we s a t down we were \ninterview ed by Pat o 'Mah ony who seeme d t o be \ncaught under the mis taken imp ression that we \nwere the James Ta y lor Quartet. Odd tha t, see­\ning as how there was six of us there. First \ntruly famous person of the day spotted was \nNICK CAVE clad in luminous yellow shorts, \na Hawaiian shirt with a stuffed Koala bear \nround r.is neck and a surf board under his \narm ....... Well no. Actually he was all in \nblack - including his girlfriend - and he \ntried to bum a quid o ff us to buy a drink. \nHe obviously needed a stiff JD as he was \nabout to join KYLIE on stage for a d uet. A \nthousand prepubescent fantasies flooded \ninto the collective male psyche of the \nstadium as she took to the stage and the \nmoshing at the front during \"Better the \nDevil you Know \" was merely an effort to \nget close to· the navel- revealing, for.mer \ntea-time temptress. Before Kylie,TRICKY \nand co . had rocked the stadium with an \nexcellent set which suffered majorily due \nto it's early time slot. Likewise BLACK \nGRAPE, who provoked the first pogoing of \nthe day w:i:th \"Reverend Black Grape\" .The \nhighlight of the weekend was up next in \nthe shape of 5\"5 ' New Yorker M:>BY who blew all \naway wi th h is brace of Hi-NRG stompers inter­\nspersed wi th a cover of Purple Ha ze and a \nHusk er Du style guitar numb er of his own .After \nthat the PRODIGY served as something of a let­\ndown and with the double interruption o f two \npowercuts. during the set - the second one sig­\nnalling set 's end - it was a bad end to a mid-\ndling day . And just when we thought it \ncouldn't get any worse : When we reached our \ntent we discovered that that large blue mar­\nquee was not a large blue drinking establish-\nment of sorts bu t weekend home of the Hare \nKr ishna 's . So it was we found ourselves sub­\njected t o chan ting until 8 :45 the next morn-\ning. Ha!Ha! But us ten t dwellers go t our \nrevenge on the Hare Krishna's by climbing up \none side o f their tent and sliding down the \nother.And I thought Hare Krishna's were non \nv io lent .........••• \nSaturday night merged into Sunday morning and \neventually a p oint where sleep no longer ma t­\ntered was reached . We made it to the s tadium \nH mmm .... Kylle's \nnavel. \nLoui se 's nipples, \nDamon ·s sweat \nstain s. \nPaul 's pout ...... \nWHERE ARE T HE \nPICT URES O F \nT E RE N CE 'S \nCHEST??! \nLIFE \nthey played all their hits - and even in \nsp ite of their delectable new singer -they \nwer e o nly the wa rm up bout to the main fight \nthat wa s BLUR .They had an aw ful lo t to live \nup t o did BLUR and while there w as nothing \nparticularly ,wr ong with the performan ce, \nit's just that it seemed a bit .... \nwell ... dead, Parklife w ithout Phil Dani els \nwa s a let down and the new material just \ndidn't seem to go down all that well.

[ w ou ld therefore suggest that the Coun ty Councils should be \nentrusted with the custody of the very numer0us remains with which the country \nis studded, embracing earthworks, pillar-stones, cromlechs, and such other \nobjects as would necessitate little or no expenditure of money, which would \nonly require to be left alone and preserved from the destruction with which \nsuch objects are daily threatened, and where irreparable injury could be done in \na few days and before any central authority at a distance could intervene. Tbe \nmere fact of their being vested in a local body, and under local supervision, would \nact as a deterrent, while the occupiers and farm labourers would be \nimpressed with their importance, instead of regarding them as incumbrances to be \ncleared off the ground as quickly as possible. This wou ld quite get over \nthe whole difficulty and objection on the score of expense, and if this plan were \nbrought before the different County Councils judiciously, there is no doubt they \nwould readily fall in with the arrangement, and counties already disposed \nto spend n1oney could still continue to take over structures involving expenditure \nif they so desirtd.

This ,vould especially apply to some portions \nof the district under notice. The author of the notes on the Cromleac \nhas had a long correspondence with Rev. Mr. Lynch, and has received \na great deal of information from the notes ,vhich he has favoured him \nwith and ,vhich we hope to make use of in a future number.

How forcibly the latter is \nbrought home to us in reading that fascinating paper by Miss Helen \nLaird in the last number of our Journal. (1) From that paper we \ncan learn too that the Gael was a close lover of nature. The description \nof the hermit in his forest abode, rightly thinking it more beautiful than \nthe King's, is a Gaelic idea. Miss Laird gives you Kuno Meyer's \ntranslation of the old Irish poem which I will repeat-\n, Two heath-clad door posts for supports-­\nAnd a lintel of honeysuckle. \nThe bravest band make, music for me \nWho have not been hired. \nIn the eyes of Christ the ever young \nI am no worse off than thou art.' \nShe also shows how truly symbolic the Gaelic names for some flowers \nwere. What more beautiful than that for the Rananculus which clothes \nthe bed of the dried-up stream and was known as 'the brooklet's \nshroud.' That such a delightful study is so much negleded in this \ncountry is much to be deplored. An effort is now being made to \nintroduce the study of Natural History into our schools, and truly it was \ntime to think of sending boys and girls into the world with minds \n(r) \"A Bohareen of Irish Botany.\" Helen Laird.

Are the bright petals flags which \nattract bees and other insects to the feasts of honey? Select some \nflowers for careful watching, be a child again, and follow the bee from \nblossom to blossom, realise the marvellous inter-actions between the \nplar.ts and their visitors. Try to think out of the every day life of the \nplant, how the roots suck up water and salts from the soil, how the \nleaves absorb air, how the sunlight shines in upon the living matter of \nthe leaf through a screen of pigment, how light and life in the leaf's \nlaboratory unite their powers, to mingle air and water and salts in subtle \nsecret ways, so that the dead becomes part and parcel of the living. \nAlready the tide has turned, and the flowers are withering and \nfading. The third act bas begun The insects and the breezes have \nfilled their role in carrying the fertilising golden dust from flower to \nflower. In the heart of each new lives are born. The seeds are being \nmade. Whence came they? How are they nurtured ? The feasts of \nhoney are over, the marriage robes of which Ruskin speaks in his \nbeautiful description of the flower (see Fors C/m,igera), are laid aside, it \nis the time of bearing fruit.

The antiquary proceeds more \nreverently and carefully, and possibly discovers a curious inscription, or \npiece of quaint mediceval sculpture, which must be sketched or copied, \nbut before his task is ended the naturalists are in the next townlands, so \nhe is forced to trek for the nearest railway station and bewail the fate \nthat brought him into such company. The scene may be fanciful, but \nit only emphasises the result of my observations. I should like very \nmuch to see the connection between the Naturalists' section and the \nArchceological maintained, but the latter section permitted to work out \nits aims and objects on independent lines if possible. \n\"The work of the members during the year did not afford me such \na field for observation, as did the objects of our association. In other \nwords the realization wasn't equal to my dreams. With such a number \nof promising members more work might have been expected. It does \nindeed seem strange that in the pages of our Journal there appear so \nfew short notes or papers of local interest in the different branches of \nNatural History, or bits of folk-lore, family histories, or family records, \nwhich might in this way be preserved, ere they disappear for ever. It \ntakes very little time to compile a few notes, or write a short paper, and \nI hope the Hon. Secretary will receive more of such in future. \nHowever, though there are some things that, perhaps, we have omitted, \nwe can look back with pride and pleasure at what has been accomplished. \nWe have maintained the Club on a solid basis for a number of years, \nwith a record of steady, if not brilliant progress. \n\"Our Journal is appreciated by those best qualified to judge of its \nmerits. The roll of members is increasing, and if each member would \nonly introduce one new member in the coming year the Journal could \nbe enlarged, and your sphere of influence for good considerably \nwidened. During the year we received the Dublin Field Club, and \nwere able to afford them a few very pleasant excursions in a country rich \nin historical as well as natural attractions, All these are successes on \nwhich we may fairly congratulate ourselves.

          "text": "This week Gillian Chawke, DROP's eye on fashion, takes a \nlook at The Miss Limerick Beauty Contest of 1998 and \nphilosophises on the merits of beauty pageants in general... ... \nBeauty contests, beouty pageants and fashion shows etc. hove all been criti­\ncised over the years, primarily by the fairer of the sex, as being demeaning \nto women, segregating the good from the bod (and the ugly?) and associat­\ning a certain \"Barbie Inspired Mon-made Bubbly Over-rated\" type beauty \nwith the girl in question. Others hove argued that it is what people want \n(mole and female) and that it is just another form of modelling. Either way \nis it the kind of entertainment the 90's women wish to be a port of? \nApparently so judging by the volume of applicants and consequently suc­\ncessful entrants into this year's Miss Limerick Beauty Pageant at the Castle \nLone Tavern, Limerick. Over 35 girls paraded the catwalk in a selection of \nday wear (of the girls choice) and evening wear while 2FM's Lorean Murray \ninquisitioned those \"lucky\" enough to be called bock with ambiguous ques­\ntions and statements which hod the girls giggling incessantly or simply stum­\nbling and stuttering over their well prepared words. Believe me this is a \npersonal recollection, it is a nerve-rocking experience that only the strong \nsurvive. It was emphasised however that all of the judges had spoken at \nlength with each of the entrants and were dose to making a decision before \nthe show hod even begun! Was the finale simply for the public's enjoy­\nment? Well if so they succeeded. \nThe night began on the riverside setting with a beautifully presented buffet \nto tempt palettes and a few \"coups\" of bucks fizz to wash it down . The \nCastle Lane Tavern, Limerick's newest/oldest public house added a wonder­\nful historical magic ambience to the event and was a cosy host to the event. \nIf the interest is anything similar \nto what they achieved this year \nthen next year's organisers \nshould begin securing a larger \nvenue now. \nThere was one entrant however \nwhose intelligent and witty \nremarks stood out amongst the \ncrowd and even had the incorri­\ngible Mr. Murray stuck for \nwords at one point. It was \nNicole Smith, who along with \nher stunning looks complement­\ned by a duck-egg blue/ green \nknit creation by local designer \nMargaret Ryan, was selected \nMiss Limerick 1998 and was repre­\nsenting The Globle /Nestors Bars \nand Restaurants. She will go on to \nrepresent Limerick at the Miss \nIreland competition held in the \nBurlington Hotel, Dublin in late \nAugust and we wish her all the \nluck in the world. \nSo do you hove what it tokes to \nenter a competition based on per­\nsonal appearance and public per­\nception? Do you hove the courage \nto stand up on a stage in front of \nyour piers and sell yourself for who \nyou ore? The real question is do you want or need to in order to convince \nyourself? Does it matter to you what other people perceive you to be? \nAre you comfortable enough with yourself and the way you look, to not \ncore? Well if you ore then no beauty contest in the world will make you \nfeel more beautiful then the radiance that is emitted from someone who is \nhappy and content with their life and themselves. Now that is something \nwe ore all striving to achieve! @ \ntHE ffiAR__~t rriGHtCLUB \nno.6 Robert street Limerick \n,omewhe,e ,ound in a \n,qua,e wo,ld \n23rd.24th.25th.26th july THURS.FRI.SAT.SUN \n11.30 TILL LATE",

          "text": "• Dave Irwin charts the career of the star of Godzilla, Matthew \nBroderick .... \nThe Eighties were strange times for teen-star Matthew \nBroderick. Everyone who was alive in the Eighties remembers \nhis computer hacker genius character in War Games from \n1983. But Broderick didn't hit the big time again until 1986 with \nthe John Hughes' classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In the \nmeantime he had done two small films and Ladyhawke with \nRutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer (only her fourth film, Grease \n2 being her first. That is easily the worst sequel of all time. \nCo incidentally, the original Grease is on re-release at the \nmoment and is celebrating its twentieth anniversary. Pfieffer \nherself currently stars in the depressing A thousand Acres with \nJessica Lange. (Can anyone name a film where she doesn't cry? \nBoy that woman can cry. Th ink about it. Rob Roy, Night And The \nCity, Music Box, Cape Fear, Far North, even Tootsie. Major tears \nevery time.Who the hell cries duringTootsie? (and speaking of \nRob Roy, Liam Neeson won 't be taking the role of Frankie in \nAngela's Ashes)). \nProject X {the one about the lab monkey) came in 1987 and \nthe following year Broderick starred in Torch Song Trilogy \n(reprising his stage role in Harvey Fierstein's landmark \nBroadway play) and also in Biloxi Blues (one of three Neil \nSimon autobiographical scripts). \nAnd then came disaster. Some of you may remember the furore \nat the time, when Broderick crashed his car into oncoming traf­\nfic and killed an older woman and her daughter. All this hap­\npened up in Enniskillen. The charge was reduced (undoubtedly \nby those infamous Hollywood lawyers) to dangerous driving and \nhe had merely to pay a fine of £ I 00. Both he and his girlfriend \nat the time, Ferris Bueller co-star Jennifer Grey, had to spend \nmonths in hospital (Grey has done zip careerwise since then \n(ok, ok, so she's done Wind and Bloodhounds Of Broadway, but \ndoes that contradict me?). Th is episode took the wind out of his \nsails and the cheeky-chappie look disappeared for some time. \nHis next venture was the worthy but depressing Glory with \nDenzel Wash ington in 1989. The tragic-comic Family Business \nw ith Dustin Hoffman and Sean Connery came along the same \nyear (a film that also had a depressing ending). In 1990 he could­\nn't resist an offer to co-star in The Freshman w ith Marlon \nBrando (who had just returned from nine years away from \nmovies with the apartheid drama A Dry White Season with \nDonald Sutherland (who 's son Kiefer, by the way, is named after \nWarren Kiefer, the screenwriter on Dona ld's first film Castle Of \nThe Living Dead from 1964)).Three years later he returned to \ncomedy with The Night We Never Met which isn't all that \nbad (but I noticed at the time that, the by then bearded, \n1111ST \nIHCIIYIIY \nBroderick was ham-fistedly air-brushed clean-shaven on the \nposters, possibly (definitely} for pleb-recognition). The next \nyear, 1994, he starred in the film with the year's finest credits \n(Anthony Hopkins, Bridget Fonda, John Cusack, Michael Lerner, \nColm Meaney and directed by (\"our own\") Alan Parker) The \nRoad To Wellville, wh ich ended up as the year's biggest \ncrock of poopie. I know he must have been thinking \"come-\nback\" at this time. He wasn't quite \"whatever-happened-to­\nwhat's-his-name\" yet but he was a bit \"something-must-have­\ngone-wrong-there\". He had part in Mrs. Parker And The \nVicious Circle as the object of affection, but the movie was \ntoo cerebral and too dumb to take off. His next attempt has \nnever been described as \"too cerebral\", The Cable Guy w ith \nJim Carrey, but it has been described as the only miss-step in \nCarrey's phenomenal ascent to stardom. I'm starting to think \nthat Broderick is cursed. But there's a happy ending. He \nworked out some personal stuff by acting, producing and \ndirecting his mother's play Infinity about Nobel Prize winner \nRichard Feynman .And he returned to excellent comic form in \nfellow Eighties man Griffin Dunne's directorial debut \nAddicted To Love with Meg Ryan.A respectable success. \nWh ich brings us up to date. Big lizard movie Godzilla is actu­\nally pretty good. I went to see it with a feeling of dread but \ncame out happy enough. Maybe it's uneven and a bit overlong, \nbut maybe it's good value for money too. Good work Matty. @",

          "text": "Starring: Casper van Dien, Dina Meyer, Michael Ironside \nIt takes balls of steel to spend millions of dollars of somebody else's \nmoney producing a film that so irreverently \nderides what it is supposed to be. But that is \nprecisely what Verhoeven has done in \n\"Starship Troopers\" and done it with such mag· \nnificently malicious enthusiasm that he war· \nrants the eternal gratitude of the entire movie· \ngoing public. For a director whose entire oeu· \nvre was once summed up as lashings of Resh \nand bags of blood, slopping around in a tri­\numph of tastelessness, this latest outing is the perfect riposte. It is all the \naforementioned and more, the sheer joy of it coming from the fact that \nVerhoeven patently knows this and revels in it. This is a vulgar, obnox· \nious, exploitative film, and that's exactly what he intended it to be. The \nscenario is stereotypical sci-fi action fodder, the future of our world \ndependant upon the heroism of a few to protect it from a vile, vicious \nand seemingly • invincible extraterrestrial foe (in this case bugs, \nalbethem the stuff of RentoKill exterminators worst nightmares.) The \ncasting is superb, possessing either an astonishing capacity to sup· \npress even a semblance of ability or else inherently talentless, they are \nso two-dimensional, so ingratiatingly Beverley Hills 90210 plastic with \nattitude, so contemptibly soddish that the earth's destruction seems a \nsmall price to pay for their complete and total annihilation. You simply \ndon't care what happens to them, their shallow superficiality perfectly \nsatirising the oft risible attempts made by films of this kind to generate \n\"real\" characters with \"real\" emotions who \"really\" carry the film. \nToss, absolute and utter. This is SFX heaven, the kids are only in it so \nthe bugs have something to decimate. Verhoeven is nobody's fool and \nimbues \"Starship Troopers\" with the same violent wit that he displayed \nto similar acclaim/outrage in \"Robocop\". He cares not a whit who is \noffended by his vision and seems to temper it simply to get a viewing \ncertificate (This is the man who famously remarked that in his cut of \n\"Basic Instincts\" infamous \"kissing\" scene you know exactly where \nMichael Douglas' tongue is and exactly what it's doing.) Rent and \nrejoice; a sly, studied piss-take and a damn fine spectacle to boot. \n-----reel llash back \nLENNY (18) \nWhat is it? The story of Lenny Bruce, leg-~· \nendary comedian/ social commentator whose ; \ncutting satire lambasting Official America out-~' \nraged the Moral Majority who saw him and his --, , __ \nstyle as borderline sedition. A victim of his own ;. • -, \nnotoriety the film charts the rise of this comic \ngenius and his slide into self-obsessed ranting. \nWho's in it? : Dustin Hoffman \nLAWN DOGS (18) \nDir: John Duigan \nStarring: Kathleen Quinlan, Christopher McDonald, Sam Rockwell, \nMischa Barton. \nIf you watch only one film this month make it \"Lawn Dogs\". From the \ndirector of \"Flirting\" and \"The Year My Voice Broke\" comes one of \nthe most enchanting and touching films I've seen in years. This mag­\nical realist tale of a young girl's burgeoning friendship with \"white \ntrash\" lawn cutter, Trent is one to be enjoyed on a number of levels. \nDirector Duigan demonstrates a simply astonishing control of both \nthe material and his actors, eliciting superbly authentic performances \nfrom all, most particularly from Mischa Barton in what is the best \nperformance from a child actor since Anna Paquin's Oscar-winning \nrole in \"The Piano\". The plot takes a simple fairy tale structure and \nimbues it with a depth and portence which inextricably draws you \ninto the narrative. Bartons sporadic, childlike rendering parallels the \nlarger, contemporary menace of the events that surround and make \nup her life. Cosseted in white-picket fenced suburbia reminisce of Tim \nBurton's \"Edward Scissorhands\" she goes outside the walls in search \nof the uncharted mystery of the forest wherein dwells Trent, her ini· \ntially reluctant confidant and eventual soulmate. At once a biting \ncondemnation of Middle American attitudes and mores and a joy· \nous celebration of of the power of imagination \"Lawn Dogs\" is sim­\nply mesmerising. If, like me, you loved \"Like Water for Chocolate\" \nyou will adore this film. To be cherished. \n---soap barometer--\nGoing Up -Ally McBeal -I know its not exactly \na soap but it is a serial and we all are following \nit.

D. 570-\n580. A thousand years later, in r 57 3, Donall O'Brien mustered his \nforces at Carn lv!ic Tail to oppose a raid of Teige, son of Conor O'Brien. \n1'he latter, with Torlough O'Brien, marched from Slievenagry, near \nKilfenora, and, leaving Smithstown (Bel atha an ghobhann) on the left, \nmarched to Kilmanaheen, and they 1net the enemy at Beal an chip, two \nmiles south from Lehinch. (19) The cairn would tally well w ith the \nsite of \"Carn Mic Tail,\" as Teige in pursuit of Donall 1nust have kept \ndown the river valley to the north of Smithsto,vn, past Kilshanny and \nthe cairn, over the ridge to l(ilmanaheen, and so on to the ford at \nLehinch, called the river Farset in the Elizabethan map s. The ancient \nnarue of the cairn is lost, but the present one is very remarkable. \nLt'gtnd, in 1839, told how in it was entombed a Connaught army, \nwhich, except three chiefs, was exterminated by the n1en of Corcomroe. \nAnother story, however, told how the Connacians pursued and sle\\V a \nmonstrous serpent, ,vhir.h they buried under the cairn.

In ro88, Roderic O'Conor, \nKing of Connaught, despite the compact of the MacCreiche legend, \nraided the Corcomroes and lost three of his chiefs, Catha! O'Mughro in, \nchief of Clan Cathail; Cu-Sionna, son of Murchad Odhar, chief of Clan \nTomaltaigb, and the son of G iolla-Chriost, son of Eachtighern, chief of \nCorca-Achlainn. vVe may conclude that the ren1oval of their bodies by \n(19) Annals of the Four Masters.",

CLARE. \nBY THOMAS JOHNSON WESTROPP, M.A., M.R.I.A. \nWe have in this Journal for several years endeavoured to point out \nthe antiquities which add an interest to the various health resorts along \nthe Clare coast. Having (so far as we were able) dealt with the remains \naccessible from :Miltown Malbay and Liscloonvarna, we naturally turn to \nthe district between them, round Lehinch. The individuality of this place \nis very marked. The irregular breakers of Miltown and Kilkee are re­\nplaced by the beautifully regular crescents of waves marching up the \nlong shallow bay of Liscannor with well marked cro5s waves deflected \nfrom each shore, travelling towards each other without deranging the \ncurved ridges on their way shoreward. The high walls of cliffs at Kil­\nkee and the low reefs of Miltown have here no equivalent. Low shale \ncliffs occur and high sand dunes, behind which a winding creek with \n.low marshy fields runs clown from Kilshanny, past where Cairn Con­\nnaughtagh hides its secret among the swamps, to the ta11, grey ghost of \nDough Castle. The creek, here a mass of rippled silver, is often full of \nopalescent jelly fish, shining with gold and purple in the sun. It, with \nthe bay, helps to form the peninsula Leath innsi, or Lebinsi, which gave \nthe village and angle its correct name. This was at first anglicised as \n\"I.ehinch.\" At present, even this less barbarous form is getting \nswallowed up by the abominable \"Lahinch\" (the yet more hurrible \n\"Lahenzey,\" used Ly Archdeacon Kenny, is fortunately, extinct). The \nother, promulgated by Lewis-father of fearful spellings-should be, in \nthese days of Irish revival, opposed by all, though the ever increasing \nranks of the golfer and the lovers of the Atlantic coast (unversed in \nname loi:e) are rapidly stereotyping it in its worst form.",

That's more lives lost than were lost by the Americans in Viet­\nnam . \nFilmed on the actual battle site, Gettysburg is a sprawling epic that covers the \nbattle from both sides point of view. Unfortunately it's a bit over zealous in \nattempts to show that no one wanted to be fighting and they all wanted to go \nhome as soon as possible. The costumes are great and the battle scenes are so \nwell filmed but in the category for the most ridiculous false beard Tom \nBerenger's must win an all time award . \nThis film is over patriotic and I would say it will bore the pance off most peo­\nple but having grown up on a diet of John \"The Duke\" Wayne I have a high \ntolerance level for almost any western.

Sounds good doesn't it? \nMaybe you have or haven't heard about the G.A.M. \nproject so here's a little info on them. G.A.M. stands \nfor \"Grey Area Music\" and was set up by lour mus ic \nloving people. Those four people are Bob Johnson, \nAnna Murphy, lain Stewart 'Closs and Gearoid \nO'Halloran. G.A.M . are a non-profit organisation prom­\nising to stand as a support structure for local musi­\ncians. This intales financial assistance, venue arrange­\nment and advertising. They basically want to take \nsome or the we ight off the bands shoulders! \nOk , so the basic low-down is that two gigs will take \nplace every month in Dolan's Warehouse, which fall \non a Thursday night. These gigs will only contain top \nquality Limerick mu sic and each gig will contain four \nbands. The line up for the first gig includes bands such \nas The Riffs (recently won the IMRO Showcase), \nAtrophy (two weeks ago won best or the bands), \nMysterious Ends and Roper. Also, included after the \nlocal mu sicians is the usual Dolan's nightclub. All this \nfor €9, student discount for €7. And if that's not \nenough for you, there is also a showcase gig on in \nThe savoy Bar every Wednesday night where some \nunknown Limerick bands will be trying to prove their \ntalent. I'm also told that in the coming weeks, G.A.M . \nshall be ra[[iing off a pair of Witnness weekend tickets \nat one of their gigs in Dolan's. \nA lot of people I know in the mus ic scene around \nLimerick first thought of this project to be a lame copy \nof the AMC. But I can tell you now that it is not a copy \ncollective as all music displayed by G.A.M . are pure \nLimerick. \nSo between both organisations Limerick is in for \nsuch a treat this sum m er. I don't think this city has \nhad so much interest in quality music over the years. \nThree years ago we were lucky to have one gig on a \nweek. Now we have a choice. \nAny assistance from local companies is greatly \nappreciated by G.A.M . and they can be contacted at \n085-7224206 or the_banana_monger@hotmail.com. \nAlso any bands interested if) playing at the gigs can \ncontact G.A.M . straight away from the same number. \n·1/.'r.buRSE .·, ·-.-~--~ ..... \nF· TiiE MEDITERRAN \n. . • • • • \". ·:. -i· :\\\\'_ ·:.: ': \n' .

I've been given far too many \ngood reviews since I started with this magazine so its time to see what dirt \nis being swept under the carpet. \nAs a lot of you are reading this review, you will realise that you have \nheard about this band before but never seen them in action. I was once in \nthis situation before so I attended a gig they were playing in Dolan's \nWarehouse. I was honestly looking forward to this gig because I had heard \nso much about the band but I'm sure I would have been better off watch­\ning reruns or Moonlighting and listening to a collection of Rod Stewart b­\nsides. 22 were awful. They started off with their usual intro, which sounds \n·like the A-Team mus ic mixed in with a bit of Nintendo Mario Brothers and \nthen they ran on stage like headless chickens and played what they \nthought was good music. There was a big group of us that night and not \none of us enjoyed their set. The only people that did enjoy there set were \nthe mini muppets at the front of the stage that just like to bang their head \nto any beat. I didn't want my opinion to be based on one gig so I met \nMartin Keary (guitar, vocals, midi programming percussion)' and Barry Brien \n(guitar) after the gig and asked him for a copy of their album 'Comrade \nMuzik'. Before I continue on anymore I must first inform you that 22 \nhaven't a drummer so they use a drum machine in replace, along with var­\nious sound snippets. \nAnyway their album has thirteen tracks ranging from loud screaming rock \n(Romancer) to soft-spoken melodies (Idle Surprise). The album is a bit bet­\nter than their live performances. Songs such as 'Wait (Panorama)' and 'Safe' \nbrought back a little dignity to my negative opinion of the band. \nSo overall, what would be my final conclusion for the 22 mad hatters. \nWell I certainly wont be paying to get into anymore of their gigs unless· \nthey're supporting System Of A Down and that is highly unlikely. But they \nmust be doing something right because from the gigs I was at, they had \nquite a following. That following may be craving for Benny Armstrong \n(bass, vocals, keyboard) to wave his genitals at them but sure hey, at least \nthere is someone listening to your music. \nMaybe it wouldn't be any harm in recruiting a drummer into the band \nbecause the drum machine can get boring after a while. Also it would be a \ngreat idea to loose the sound machine as well. The boys can play guitars \nvery well so there is no need for unnecessary background sound clips. \nIn context for the future the boys are planning to release a new album \nwith Keith Lawlor from giveamanakick on drums. Some possible tracks on \nthe album could be 'Steve Martin', 'Pano' and 'American Retard'. They have \nalready taken part in the 'Mother of Mercy' album, which is a compilation \nof Irish underground music. Swarm are another Limerick band taking part in \nthis album. • \nIf you would like to get in contact with 22 for a demo or more informa­\ntion than their email address is www.geocities.com/kearyy \nthis issue, ourt a I e n t s p o tt e r, kieran \nmcguire, has unearthed a new collective pledging \nto give barely rivalled support to local talent. say \nhello to gam.",

LEG seized the opportunity to speak with the man himself about the new album, the Oolans' gig, Shane McGowan and vacuum \ncleaners. Hold on to your seats. \nDamien visits limerick in the middle of a three-month national lour, taking in locations such as Belfast, Dublin, Cork, lisdoonvarna and Killarney, \nfinishing with tw_o dates at the Galway Arts Festival. It seems that Damien is not too well known in this corner of the country, but he is set to \nchange that. The gig is a well-needed boost to the Dublin Northsider's limerick following, as he admits himself. \nThe earlies.I memory of Damien Dempsey would perhaps be his 1999 greatly unique 'Dublin Town' single, which received, if memory serves \nme , endless airplay on the then Dave Fanning show. (Ah, the memories!) His musical style is usually one of madness and sometimes incoher­\nence. His lyrics are strong, when you can hear them, and his mus ic is fast, but effective. He has been described by Larry Mullen Jnr as a 'real \nDublin rapper.' Sinead O'Connor compares him to Luke Kelly and says that he 'just wipes the floor with them.' \nWhen I mention 'Dublin Town', he gasps in despair. \"Don't mention the war,\" feeling it was perhaps a misrepresentation of his true musical tal­\nents at a time when he was naive and clueless. ft was also, \nI k \nit tias to be said, a time when everything on the radio \na Yo U n g U e \nsounded the sa e, and so it came as a welcome change. \n. \n\"It proba~ly did me more harm than good,\" he cringes, but \nconvinces ,me that his new album should be a bit clearer \nand more developed lyrically. Thankfully. \nDamien's vocals are possiply Incoherent to some, but he \ndamien dempsey I the warehouse I May 22 promises that things have improved. He says he's taking elocution lessons, to help \nhim wllh his heavily influenced Dublin pronunciation and diction, but I'm not sure \nif I believe him. He tells me how an Interpreter, even a karaoke screen, might have been handy during his New York gigs. \nSpeaking about his involvement with the recent 'Other Voices: Songs From a Room' project he is extremely positive, declaring that It's a great \nopportunity for Irish artists like himself to gain exposure. 'It gives artists a new stage•, artists perhaps that would otherwise remain unknown. \nOf course he has only good things to say abput the lead man Glen Hansard, who gave him a few gigs in the early days, saying he's a •good \npiece of skin' or whatever the phrase isl • \nDamien says of his new album 'Seize The Day' is different to his 2000 release 'They Don't Teach This Shit in School' In that his voice has devel· \noped and is now sweeter and clearer. 'There's a bit of love, a bit of anger: He sings diversely about Irish history, his experiences in New York \nand the drugs epidemic in Ireland, and collaborates wltli such big music names as Shane McGowan, Kieran Kiely, Sin~ad O'Connor and Brian Eno. \nShane McGowan is a passionate supporter or Damien's !llUSic alter he heard him play in an Irish-American pub in New York. He even provided \nhim with a few Irish gigs, one in Cork which resulted in Damien being \"face d_own on the ground at eight o'clock in the morning• and the clean­\ners trying to manoeuvre the vacuum cleaner around his head. Pure rock star style. While recording a single for a Chernobyl c~arlty with McGowan \nthere were more rock star antics, resulting in his harmopies being pulled lrom the final track, because McGowan believed that Damien was too \ndrunk. He must have been really drunk. • . . \nDamien has been the special guest on Sln~ad O'Connor.during her 2002/2003 UK and European tour. When tasked him about her receql deci• \nsion to retire from the music industry, Damien seems quite shocked at llrst, but claims that she could change her mind. 'Give her a few months \nand she'll probably go on the road again.\" He goes on )o state his support of one of her more controversial Issues, stating that women should \nbe allowed to become priests, not that he aspires to becoming a nun. \nDamien Dempsey's single 'Negative Vibes' is out no'-:' and his album 'Seize the Day' Is released on the 16th. He plays Dolans' warehouse on \nthe 22nd, so be sure to catch up with him. Failing that, :he appears on the 'Late Late Show' the following day. •Seize him If you can. ,",

Big col­\nlective wow , they were !°'king great to \nCork's Rest and Weevil (two very different, \nciaran ryan runs through the diary ....... . \nyet two of the best instrumental rock acts to come out of Ireland, let alone Cork) \nwho played the Forward The Revolution. Tour, the Steve-Albini produced rock n roll \nextravaganza that was Giddy Motors, with top-notch support from the mighty \nGiveamanakick and Ten Past Seven, and finally to original purveyors of Mamrock, \nThe Dudley Corporation who played last Friday with support from another emerg­\ning Cork act, Wa iting Room . \nAnyway, here's what's happening AMC-wise over the next lorthnight. Friday May \n09 sees the return ol Japanese three-piece eX-Girl, who by all accounts played a \nblistering set at the High Stool last July. Unfortunately, I was at what was appar­\nently Ireland's premier festival that weekend, but have been reliably informed \nthat the girls did indeed rock. Mark O Connor isn t a man for bullshit, and writing \nin· the pages ol this publication, he declared al the time that eX-Girl = excellent . \nThe reason I am rambling like this is that I have just received a copy ol their third \nalbum, entitled Big When Far, Small When Close. Let's just say that I am not over­\nly fond of it! The album sees eX-Girl neglecting the traditional rock and roll instru­\nments ol guitar and bass, by instead incorporating the likes ol Tubas, Wood \nBlocks(!), and the most demanding or them all, handclaps. In fairness, the prime \ninstrument on the album is their voices, with three-way harmonies utilised \nthroughout. At times, it is actually wonderful. Other times, however, It is not. \nNevertheless, they will be reverting to their regular duties when they play the \nHigh Stool, with Kirilola on vocals/bass/keyboards, Keikos on guitar and vocals, \nand latest addition Chapple (who incidentally doesn t appear on Big When Far) on \ndrums and vocals. My instincts (and sources) !eel that this show should not be \nmissed, despite my reservations about their record! \nAnyway, there are other reasons to go in the semblance of two support acts. \nneed any further convincing? Tickets are on \nthe door at €8. \nThe ex-Girl gig is probably the biggest \none happening this forthnight, but the AMC \nhave plenty coming up. Here s a quick \nround up ol some of the other highlights. \nOn Sunday May 11, the High Stool on \nCatherine Street is yet again the venue, \nwhen Norwegian's Noxagt headline. \nAccording to the press blurb, the three \npiece perform heavy and powerful self­\nstyled \"Nor Wave\", using downtuned bass \nguitar and crushing often shilling drums, \nthe distorted, droning viola adding rhyth­\nmic and harmonic disorientation. \nEverything else is unfortunately in \nNorwegian, so I call you II have to figure it \nout for yourself when they play. a4 on the \ndoor will get you in. . \nFriday May 16 sees Charlottefield play the \nHigh Stool. By the sounds of tracks like \nAgain, their mo st recent release as a split \n7\", Fugazi would perhaps be the most obvi­\nous reference point. Other bands that they \nhave been compared to include The Fall \nand Television. If those comparisons are \ntrue, this could be a cracking gig. Support comes from Waiting Room , and in my \nbook they are more than worth the a4 that it II cost to get in on the night. \nFinally, The Apes, who played w ith Alta May in December, return to the High \nStool on Sunday May 18th. The four-piece have been making waves in \nWashington DC since they formed in 1999. Time Out gave them the best possible \ncompliment when they noted thus: \"In a world where dreary indie choir-boys like \nStarsailor are hyped to the skies, this ain't no joke. It's all-out gorilla warfare\". \nSupport comes from Party of Helicopters and Estel. \nThat s it for this issue. Check out www .theamc.net and forthcoming issues of \nLEG for information on forthcoming shows from Acid Mother's Soul Collective, \nJetplane Landing and the return of New Jersey hip-hoppers Dalek. \nElectric Eel Shock (also from Japan) claim, \"We don t know much English but we \nlove Rock & Roll\". Since releasing their wonderfully titled debut album 'Maybe I \nThink We Can Beat Nirvana' in 1997, EES have been crafting high-octane, riff­\nheavy rock tunes. Fans ol garage-rock in the vein of the Jon Spencer Blues \nExplosion and The Wh ite-Stripes are going to enjoy tracks like 'Japanese Meets \nChinese In The USA' and 'Rock and Roll Can Save the World' . Yet, there is more \nthan a hint of heavier rock and metal influences, with EES even having a track \ncalled 'I Wanna Be A Black Sabbath Guy'. What s more, the lrontman has a hair­\ndo that could easily lit into At The Drive In, and the drummer ·is prone to appear­\ning on stage sans clothes. Reports suggest that they really can cut the mustard \nlive, throwing shapes and kicking out the jams and all that. Even better news is \nthat the consistently wonderful (and loud) Giveamanakick will be opening on the \nnight, playing all the hits from their forthcoming opus 'Is it OK To Be Loud, Jesus?', \nwhich I am told will be available in all the best record emporiums soon.
